Attack,a deposit system can foster consumer loyalty to specific retailers.,"chaos has also been linked to installing drs in stores , which would have a negative effect on customer's loyalty."
Attack,jehoiachin was released from prison on the 27th day of the 12th month 2 kings 25:27 but also the 25th day of the 12th month jeremiah 52:31 .,there is good reason to believe that the common copying error of dittography is what occurred here.
Support,"democracy validates tyranny. giving it the backing not of divine right, but, rather similarly, a supposing of legitimacy and a supposing of the will of the people.","the greatest proposed virtue of democracy is that it keeps tyrants at bay, yet it has often only given tyrants legitimacy, shroud, and the ability bleed off the revolutionary will of the people with vain democratic hope."

Attack,it is a well established historical fact that both james jesus brother and paul formerly known as saul were both skeptics of jesus resurrection and were both converted to faith in jesus. these conversions would not have taken place on such little evidence as a missing body.,"there is only one source of this information. if 10,000 readers of the hobbit agree that hobbits are small, it doesn't make the lord of the rings a historical fact."
Attack,sikhism promotes belief in a range of supernatural powers .,sikhism teaches that a focus on supernatural powers is an obstacle to spiritual development .
Attack,"eating meat, in the majority of cases, involves the cruel and immoral treatment of animals.","the statement is unclear as it is not specified what the majority of cases are. what delineates those from the others, supposedly not cruel or not immoral?"
Attack,john 20:30 implies that jesus performed many miracles after he was resurrected.,the absence of any explicit reference to these many miracles by any nt author or other early christian suggests this verse was included to cover the many disparate legends that arose about jesus rather than corresponding to actual historical events.
Support,the verses in the new testament regarding the lives of prophets are contradictory.,"jesus does matthew 25:31 33 , john 5:22 and does not john 8:15 judge anyone."
Support,people who intent to do serious harm are unlikely to be caught in the visa screening process.,"in the past, islamic radicals have used fake passports and faked immigration documents to travel."

Attack,"this scene potentially creates retrospective plot hole. if a ship can crash into tangible objects while in hyperspace, no pilot could be reasonably expected to avoid asteroids or small moons over millions of light years between jumps.","the vastness of space and the infrequency of objects in it means that it is highly unlikely that one would come into contact with anything were one to draw any line between two clear points in the universe. imagine plotting a course between two points at sea and then considering how likely it is you would hit a specific grain of rice. space is very, very empty."
Support,empirical evidence is consistent with a deterministic universe that lacks free will.,"free will is not compatible with our understanding of the mechanisms that govern the universe and, therefore, likely does not exist."

Attack,"the negative aspects of a monopoly in private industry are results of coercive and absolute price setting power. this power allows an unaccountable entity to profit by abusing its buyer and supplier classes. if a state is democratically accountable to its people and has no profit motivation, a state monopoly does not present the same fundamental problem.","state actors have repeatedly displayed the very behavior described, using its price setting power as a bludgeon against suppliers and buyers within a market."
Attack,"if ukraine were allowed to join nato, it would initiate world war three.",nato forces have engaged in military action before without initiating world war iii. there is no reason why such a war would start this time.

Support,"in a changing world , religion provides a sense of continuity","religion, having been practiced for centuries , provides a sense of stability to its followers."
Support,"most people support the idea of 'basic human rights' but the common definition of what is a basic human right, or who deserves basic human rights, has changed over time. political correctness serves to inform our ideas of what is a basic human right by pointing out when we treat others as though they are not people.","the non pc term illegal is a good example. when one refers to an undocumented person as an illegal, they are using the term as a noun. the crime is considered to render the individual as opposed to the individual s actions at one point in time as being illegal. it implies that a person s existence is criminal . this is a form of dehumanization . using pc terminology instead highlights that they are a person with the same human rights as the speaker."
Support,"during israel palestine conflicts, jews around the world are often targeted as proxies of israel by those who support the cause of palestine. for example, the 2023 israel hamas war saw a rise in antisemitism across the world.","in the month after the conflict began, the number of antisemitic incidents recorded in france more than doubled the total number of incidents in 2022."

Support,"recognizing palestine may take away from the factors that motivate terrorism against israel, reducing pressure on regional security forces.","palestinian terrorism against israel is linked to their loss of identity through foreign domination, and the lack of progress in creating a nation. recognizing palestine might help to overcome these feelings and signify political progress."

Attack,"current farming practices prevent certain species from going extinct. animals bred on farms have been selectively bred for centuries, resulting in genetically imprinted tendencies. many widely farmed species are incapable of surviving in the wild. with many species being sustained solely to provide nutritional purpose, veganism would effectively disincentivise the further preservation of these species. notably, cattle, chickens, and sheep come to mind.",preservation of species may not be more important than avoiding condemning members of said species to ongoing and indefinite suffering.

Attack,"even if you convince one person to support utilitarianism, it is quite tough for the philosophy to spread, as it is somewhat awkward to push it for political elections in abstract, short conversations. we should maximize happiness in society and politics through politics?!","utilitarianism can spread in contexts where people can easily visualize and connect it to political consequences, for themselves and their listeners."
Support,"evil, by definition, requires intent; and intent is a manifestation of free will. suffering is not evil. intentionally causing someone to suffer is evil. therefore, natural occurring phenomenon, like hurricanes, illness, or car accidents cannot be properly defined as evil.","even natural predators, such as lions are not seen as evil , despite hunting and killing other animals and even humans, because of their lack of free will"

Support,"capitalism, by virtue of the free market and a general lack of state intervention, enables more freedom than any comparable systems.","one of the foundations of capitalism is the idea that transactions should be voluntary and not imposed, as is the case for government mandated taxes."

Support,the biological distinctions between men and women are not sufficient to override the desires of the individual.,biological sex has less impact on athletic performance than hormones.
Attack,"if someone has no faith in their moral convictions, how can they say they are true? moral relativism is grounded in the idea that we cannot know what is good and therefore does not speak on the good or of it.",the point of relativism is to judge actions as good or bad based on the context of the society in which one lives. it is an inherently subjective framework but nonetheless enables moral judgements to take place.

Attack,"if virtually everyone learned about epistemology, logic and psychological biases in an efficient manner, virtually everyone could be very consistently open minded and critical. such people are incredibly useful for solving major problems in society.","hardly anyone is very consistently open minded and critical, and we don't know how to make them that way expecting a class in epistemology to achieve such results is hopelessly optimistic."
Support,"this claim is a generalization. it is impossible to claim that the meat industry as a whole is harmful to its workers. some companies may be harmful to its workers, but to apply this characterization to all companies in the meat industry is not logically sound.","this claim depends on an assumption that eating meat of any kind only supports large scale meat production. there are many sources of meat that do not fit that description, and among those sources, harm to workers compares very well with peer operations in sustainable agriculture."
Attack,"just as requiring girls to cover their faces or boys to wear a turban is seen as good by some and bad by others, this too would be a debatable point.",garments are not permanent surgical alteration. if one's religion mandated that infants be lobotomized at birth there is no amount of ethical relativism that could absolve the horrific repugnance of this act. forcing a baby to cover its face is no comparison.

Support,most religions have standards of justice and morality that facilitate the execution of violence.,religion has beliefs that reduce an individual's sense of personal accountability for their actions.
Support,"discoveries of decades of abuse of power have brought the priesthood under harsh scrutiny , limitations, and disrepute.",the declining church membership due to revelations of abuse has decreased the influence priests have over society.

Attack,companies are more likely to retain the money saved on salaries for other purposes rather than redistribute it.,companies that do that would likely face backlash from their employees.
Attack,"medical experts disagree over whether children and teenagers should be allowed to take puberty blockers. this divide in scholarly opinion suggests that it would be more prudent to regard gender exploration as a phase, so that permanent changes are not made based on transient feelings.","many individuals who cannot affirm their true gender experience adverse mental health effects, including suicidality . as such, it is prudent to respect an individual's inner experiences."
Attack,the private sector has a certain history of altering research results in commercially convenient manners.,government funded research also has a history of falsifying information or directing results in politically convenient ways.
Attack,the fact that women are more likely than men to report that their stress levels are increasing could be an indicator of future negative effects on their health and longevity as they progressively enter the world of work.,"given that women still live on average 5 years more than men , it seems like it does not affect their long term health."
Attack,the accounts of noah's life and the flood narrative within old testament are at odds with each other.,"the 40 days mentioned in genesis 7:17 is how long it rained, but the total amount of time the world remained flooded, including after it stopped raining, was 150 days genesis 7:24 , 8:3 ."

Support,for profit prisons are an egregious example of profit motives overriding concern for people.,reports suggest that poorly aligned profit motives incentivize private prisons to increase recidivism rates for prisoners compared to public prisons.
Attack,"an lgbt inclusive curriculum should teach the importance of stable, committed relationships, including the rights and protections provided within legally recognised marriages and civil partnerships and the legal status of other long term relationships.",not all students will be in or want to be in relationships or be married. having this as part of the curriculum would force an ideology that one must be in a committed relationship to achieve success or happiness in life.

Support,"scientifically speaking, a creator teapot would be as provable as a deity. philosophically speaking, it is a weaker idea since it would not be maximally great. also, it would be philosophically stronger than atheism.","maximally great means having all power, all knowledge, and being morally perfect. these cannot exist apart from one another total justice requires total truth and power . our universe requires all these since 1 it exists 2 there is inate justice even demonstrated to, but not limited to, some falsifiable extent and 3 there is objective truth."

Attack,"the anthropic principle can be discarded because it predicts that a random observer is overwhelmingly likely to be a boltzmann brain . in a random, atheistic universe boltzmann brains are far more common than normal observers because they do not require entropy to be as low.",the rules governing the universe are likely such as to make non boltzmann brains much more likely to form than boltzman brains.
Support,"in 1834, britain abolished slavery, freeing over 800,000 african slaves.","given the power and influence of the british empire across the globe, the abolition set a precedent for similar legislation in other nations engaged in slave trade."

Attack,us support enables the idf and the israeli government to choose hostility over engaging in peaceful negotiations with palestinians and neighboring arab states.,"the us support for israel often includes technology specifically designed for defence over offence, such as the iron dome."
Support,"the fact that one nation can disrupt the will of all the others in completely dumb, unfair, and against fundamentals of democracy. it is fair that some nations get more power than others due to having a bigger chunk of the population, but smaller member states still deserve a mostly equal vote in any policies that might affect them, or the bigger states will run over them. the purpose of the un is to give all nations a say, and this veto power undermines that.","veto power could be considered either as safeguard or , vice versa, roadblock to global development. but looking at real situation in 2024, it's enormous roadblock and not safeguard. un is rendered useless because of this."
Attack,public support for a wage cap would likely be even higher if americans were aware of how much ceos actually earn.,most americans already believe that ceos are over paid.
Support,"given current methods of agricultural production, the world will be unable to meet growing food demand. it is therefore urgent that we increase agricultural productivity by producing less meat.",current crop yields are growing too slowly to meet expected increases in food demand.
Support,"it's not clear that this ad was beneficial for men's issues. it has happened before that some feminist ads had some problems , even when they're selling a good value as empowerment of women . this could be the same, even if it criticizes toxic masculinity, it could be ill designed.","to say the right thing, to act the right way is part of the message of the ad. it seems to be telling people what to do and how to behave. this doesn't seem to be a healthy message for men."
Support,turkey is the european union's sixth largest export destination .,the european union earned 93.20 billion in export revenue from turkey in 2021.
Support,"these costs are usually a small fraction tax revenue, which means that the rest of the tax revenue can be spent purely for societal gains trusting that the investment decisions of a government are based around best social return on investment.","since the cost is placed on a price in an existing market, it will not be much different from a tax on gasoline."
Support,sexual assault against women increased significantly following the publication of target s gender inclusion policy in april 2016.,there were more instances of sexual assault in target locations in 2016 and 2017 than in prior years.

Attack,they can still be credited to actual people such as by an account of the person linking to the wikipedia account and vice versa.,"many people do not have their own webpages, especially verified profile pages, from where they could link."
Attack,a child's bodily autonomy is already considered to be limited.,"teachers, unlike parents, who have legal authority and state mandated responsibility over children, usually administer corporal punishment without exercising such authority."
Support,"wikipedia is, at the same time, generally not considered a platform for discourse but an encyclopedia.","debates, such as article for deletion debates and discussions after content removals , are not streamlined for being constructive. they can become lengthy back and forth with certain users repeating their claims over and over but not addressing the points raised or become mere headcount voting in contradiction with wikipedia policies ."
Attack,capitalism incentivizes productivity among workers.,the pursuit of productivity in capitalism created many over specialized jobs which are repetitive and alienating for the workers.
Support,"heads of religions recognize only the parts of science which fit the description of the world they already give to the masses. all other science is called sacrilege and untrue and the proponents are persecuted. that narrows fields of scientific research and slows down the spread of new discoveries. examples: book burning , galileo galilei , charles darwin .","with religions often claiming things contrary to science, it can not only encourage irrational thought, but encourage to the point of normalizing anti science attitudes such as climate change denial."
Support,"foreign aid assistance can fight terrorism, keeping individuals safe.","foreign aid can help promote a positive image of the west, making individuals less inclined to be radicalized towards violence against the west."
Support,"pharmacists have knowledge in compounding and dispensing drugs. in the past, some pharmacists that compounded drugs would dispense and advertise their own medicine, making a profit instead of attending to the actual needs of the customer patient.","physicians have also made, advertised, and sold their own drugs, regardless of benefit harm to patients. this does not mean that other members of the profession should not be allowed to prescribe."
Support,air travel is now accompanied by a plethora of safety measures to help ensure it is as safe as possible.,"many countries, where they do allow air travel, expect travellers to produce a negative covid 19 test before departure, and a negative pcr test upon their arrival to their destination country."
Attack,"in many cases, the values prioritised by sustainable development and climate change adaptability are in broad alignment with efforts to improve quality of life.",fossil fuels are essential for increasing living standards in developing countries. efforts to restrict the exploitation of fossil fuels may impact these people's quality of life.
Attack,"widespread societal agreement about obesity's unacceptability can help support policy changes that may prevent obesity, like scheduling more time for physical education in schools or taxing sugary drinks.",there's already widespread agreement about the undesirability of an obese population.

Attack,"finland is expected to spend 2.38 of its 2023 gdp on defense, which will cost the country an estimated 7 billion.","it is possible finland will be able to recoup the cost eventually, through money saved in the absence of a large scale war due to the nato deterrent."

Attack,"at a time when teen depression and suicide rates are rising significantly , influential literature aimed at impressionable young adults should not be overly dark or traumatic.","stigma around mental illness only augments the challenges faced by young people. creating open dialogue, in the ways that ya novels do, is a positive addition to the lives of young people ."
Attack,"like the suffering servant, jesus was despised and rejected by men isaiah 53:3 .","many people are rejected by some men, accepted by others."
Attack,"citizens aren't required to be polite, they are only required to obey the law.",the law often protects people from being harassed or discriminated against . what some people consider to be impolite or 'un pc' might be considered to be rude harassment by the law.
Support,"there is no necessary correlation between a particular cuisine, restaurant or dish's level of prestige and whether it includes meat or not.",the michelin guide recommends plenty of vegetarian restaurants; there are more meat serving restaurants listed simply because they appeal to a larger pool of potential guests.
Attack,social pressures have proven effective in promoting the use of correct pronouns without the need for legislation.,gender non conforming people suffer discrimination more frequently than others and thus may not be in a position to use social pressure to counter misgendering.
Attack,"the grief hallucinations would not have suddenly stopped for all the disciples after 40 days acts 1:3, 9 .","the point is only mentioned in luke acts, which was written around 80 ce, making it of dubious veracity."
Support,consumers are more important actors than producers.,"all producers are also consumers, but all consumers are not producers."
Support,"looks can be deceiving. in this case, it is cruel for the donkey, which also belonged to the zoo.","how much domesticated an animal is, should not be a standard to justify mistreatment or harm. in canada the codes of handling domestic animals defines high standards for the basic principles of animal care and management. the purpose of these codes are to promote the welfare of animals."
Attack,the socioeconomic system will not plausibly change in ways that will allow it to rationally and coherently develop reasonable values and goals before a superintelligent ai emerges.,"transformation to such a system may not need to be largely complete but only advanced enough in the, roughly described, rational goal setting area for this to be very relevant in this context."
Attack,"can and actually will are miles apart. the fact that most results in studies show that complications such as infections from bad hygiene are far more frequent amongst uncircumcised males, proves this.","it is irrelevant if the alternate options to circumcision will be used or not, their existence as viable alternatives is sufficient to replace circumcision if it were banned."
Support,the marvel universe is more popular than the dc universe.,marvel uses fan service to grow its fandom and drive up fan interest.
Attack,"the doctrine of mary could have already been known to paul's audience, which explains why he didn't explicitly teach it.","paul was sending letters to churches he himself started. that is, he was their primary source for christian doctrine. so if he didn't mention it to them, they likely wouldn't know about it. as none of the epistles mention mary, it is highly unlikely the fledgeling churches paul was writing to could have known about mary."
Attack,"the rate of change of co₂ concentration is an issue, as it is too fast to allow species to adapt. as such, there may be negative consequences.",plants already have adaptations that allow them to cope with an increased co₂ concentration; this may help to preserve biodiversity as not all food chains are jeopardised.

Support,opt in and opt out mechanisms don't offer a meaningful choice to families.,"children whose parents choose not to opt into corporal punishment are often sent home or suspended , which is inconvenient for parents working long hours."
Attack,"this is false, e.g. there are subsidies for animal products , these could simply be abandoned.","removing existing subsidies would put products on an even playing field, not put disfavoured products at a disadvantage and favoured ones at an advantage."
Support,current unspecific laws make it difficult to classify a wide variety of firearms.,"unclear laws have led to difficulties in classifying assault weapons , which are often misconstrued to comprise machine guns."
Attack,most animals exist with the single purpose of ensuring their own and their family's survival. their morality is limited by the scope of this purpose. they can therefore not derive any dignity as it does not exist within their own moral framework.,many animals that live in packs or prides fight for leadership. winning the fight that grants the alpha role gives pride while losing against an adversary gives shame. animals can clearly inherit the concept of dignity.
Attack,"for example, there is substantial evidence that insects cannot feel pain , so eating insect meat would not be immoral.","just because insects cannot sense damage, does not mean we have the right to end their lives or severely impair them."
Attack,we are missing and or lacking in capabilities to accomplish this at the moment.,"no because we can't yet is not a valid motivation either. first you should decide if it's useful and we are here , then you should decide how to accomplish it only then you'll figure out if it's actually possible or convenient ."
Attack,"the introduction to this technology in rogue one is so fleeting, it could hardly be considered an addition to the lore at all. there is little lore to honour, much less form a significant plot point around.",hyperspace tracking is mentioned in one movie and then occurs in the next. this is a valid form of narrative foreshadowing .

Attack,some buddhist sects espouse violence against muslims.,religious violence against muslims is associated with buddhist extremist groups rather than the religion as a whole.
Support,"that fewer women hold positions of power is simply a reflection of women's life choices, rather than evidence of systemic discrimination.","men typically work longer hours, do more dangerous work, and take less time off . businesses value these choices more than the alternatives."

Attack,"how much meat to produce will be solved automatically by supply and demand. if food is scarce, prices will rise, and the most efficient forms of production will be favored.","food shortages will primarily harm the world's extreme poor, who have very little purchasing power and are unlikely to be able to affect market trends."
Support,money is a small price to pay for membership in the most powerful military alliance in the world.,ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy once characterised nato membership as the best security guarantee imaginable.

Attack,they also wouldn't have been forced to suffer as they often are in modern factory farming.,"the idea of suffering doesn't apply to most stock animals. cows, chickens, most of them get to roam and live in groups. animals aren't being whipped and fed poison to sleep. in fact some are given the best quality of food and care to ensure high quality products, i.e wagyu meat, free range eggs."
Attack,to be reintegrated implies that the two were once separated.,"according to the confederate declarations of secession for the period of the civil war, they were separate."

Attack,in isolation an end can never truly justify the means in all cases. in civilised society time and again we attempt to restrict means by which ends are acceptably accomplished e.g. murder and war crimes being prominent examples.,"paralysis by choice is a real phenomenon but in most cases action is a preferable means to reach finality. which means that even if the wrong action was employed, still some resolutions is reached."
Attack,globalisation is synonymous with cultural homogenization and an increased lack of diversity.,globalisation enriches cultures by bringing more of them together.
Attack,"europe and north america contain less than 20 of the world's population. if the state were democratic, it would not be dominated by the west.","the dominance of the west has never been through numerical strength, but via other factors."
Attack,"under stressful circumstances , women are more likely to make decisions that lead to positive outcomes, whereas men tend to make risky decisions.","women are less risk tolerant when stressed, but it's incorrect to assume the safest choice is the best choice. for example, the fda has been criticized for being overly cautious in delaying approval for vaccines, resulting in thousands of unnecessary deaths. evidence suggests that the fda's inability to tolerate risk is pervasive and deadly."
Attack,the state has a moral obligation to fight poverty.,capitalism free trade is the best way to fight poverty.

Support,the scrutiny of wealth should be done exclusively by experts.,"the proper evaluation and assessment of complex financial portfolios requires context and specialised knowledge, the lack of which can lead to a distorted picture of individuals finances and cause them further difficulties."
Support,"governments include regulatory bodies that supervise media and telecommunications, empowering them to govern disseminated content and setting a precedent for acceptable discourse regulation.","in some jurisdictions, internet service providers isps are required by law to block certain websites or types of content that are deemed illegal or harmful."
Support,linux is not a user friendly operating system. hence it cannot be the best.,"for users familiar with consumer centric os versions mac, windows , the learning curve for linux may appear very steep. this may be due to trade offs between generic usability and power user considerations. an unsophisticated user may need to self educate before being able to use the more advanced features of the system."
Attack,humans are naturally inclined to cooperate with one another.,"organisms that cooperate have more reproductive success, so most organisms cooperate on earth. that says nothing about whether cooperation fundamentally should occur."
Attack,"special pleading. accepting the general principle also means belief in vishnu or allah or the great demon is properly basic, a position incompatible with most theists' religions.","as allah simply means god in arabic, this is a poor example of something that would be incompatible with theism."
Support,"courts uphold precedent because, to be perceived as fair and just, the law must be enforced in a predictable manner , such that two similar cases receive the same verdict. if this does not happen, public faith in the judiciary will be undermined.","most criminal cases are routine matters , such as traffic infractions, in which laws are enforced in a relatively predictable way."

Support,"while much meat farming is cruel, it does not have to be. ethical consumers could choose only to buy from ethical sources i.e. free range farming that afford animals the same if not better quality of life than they would have had in the wild, and a painless death.",all animals are not the same in their ability to grow meat while suffering. good animal welfare and meat quality is highly correlated with high meat production rates in beef for example. there is a profit incentive to increasing animal welfare outcomes in this case. therefore if consumers chose to eat meats of this type there would be financial incentives for the big meat producers to maximise animal welfare.
Attack,"extraction and transport of resources to the location of highest worth would be expensive, slow, and also resource intensive.","the escape velocity is much lower for mars, making it not too resource intensive."
Attack,the film adaptations were a disappointment for many.,"adaptations are distinct works that can, and in this case should, be analysed separately."
Attack,the bible isn't advocating anything. it is telling a story with a remarkable similarity to actual events predating human observers.,"the bible broadly says in what order things were created, at least one of which birds before land animals appears to be false. that some of the broad statements seem to match does not indicate anything remarkable about the account."
Attack,selling a gun on the black market requires significant interaction with serious criminal elements.,"black market gun sales have increasingly moved to the dark web , where purchases can be made easily and anonymously."
Attack,"the government provides most of the necessary infrastructure, such as fiber optic cable, the internet needs to operate.","this is not the case in the uk, where bt provides the infrastructure for nearly all homes and businesses."

Attack,there is no way of accurately measuring suffering in an animal.,existence of pain can be confidently determined even if the accurate amount of pain is uncertain.
Attack,"the founding fathers wanted to balance government power in favor of the states , so most offenses were addressed by state rather than federal laws. thus, the power to pardon originally had limited scope for misuse, as there were few federal offenses.","many states confer the right to pardon on the governor, and many state constitutions predate the us constitution . thus, presidential and gubernatorial pardon powers collectively underscore the broad range of offenses that are subject to executive oversight."
Attack,"the eu has not done enough to assist the movement of immigrants into the region, given the devastation caused by the earthquakes in turkey and syria.",the eu does not need to offer migrant access in addition to its support for the affected regions.

Attack,transhumanism's not needed as long as people know how to work with automation to accomplish tasks.,"this will only work as long as people are capable of understanding how robots work. once robots reach a certain point of complexity, humans will need enhancements to work with them."
Attack,"by that logic, we would have to prohibit everything, since nobody can look into the future to be absolutely certain of all consequences of their actions.","the reasoning is not necessarily that masturbation should always be prohibited. the grandparent claim is an argument against the soundness of the implied argument made by its parent . it is a counterargument to the specific pro in favor of masturbation being acceptable , so it does not need to implicitly indicate that masturbation is always unacceptable to be substantially impactful."
Support,many other places in the world accept enormous amounts of immigrants and can still do well.,"inj the united arab emirates, immigrants make up 95 per cent of the population."
Support,"humans are not uniquely capable of creating culture, art or science.",non human primates have developed tools for various purposes including gathering and hunting. this proves that they are capable of performing scientific discoveries for their society.

Support,"we need not concern ourselves with defending the gospels every claim attributed to jesus because critical evaluation factors can assess the probability of specific events surrounding jesus life. these include historical congruence, independent, early attestation, embarrassment, dissimilarity, semitisms, and coherence.","independent, early attestation s appears in multiple sources which are near to the time at which s is alleged to have occurred and which depend neither upon each other nor a common source can be used to evaluate the events of jesus life."
Support,the salvation mission attributed to jesus by christians is foreign to the hebrew religion.,christianity introduces a godhead which is foreign to hebrew theology.

Attack,"this assumes that methodological failure implies impossibility, i.e. that many have failed to conclusively prove the existence of god implies that the contrary is true. if this were to be true, absurd examples arise, viz. the lack of proof of quarks to people in the 1800s and earlier, despite the thousand years of search for a smallest unit, implies the nonexistence of quarks.",see 1.1.1.2.2.1.2.4.1.10.5.1.3.1.1.2.1.7.1.1.1.1.3.1.

Support,"the problem in the present, and near future and likely to a large degree also the further future is not the ai, it is the humans and society i.e. socioeconomic system that builds and uses it. while technology is not neutral, the kind of technology being built is shaped by the surrounding structures. ai software are not autonomous self directed agents, they are extensions or tools and humans have agency over them that needs to not be essentially ignored.","for example, risks of nuclear bombs are not solved merely by having a focus fixated largely on the technical design of nuclear bombs, but by considering the bigger picture of society, geopolitics, security architectures, and so on including why these are built and why they may be used."

Support,"many disciples would have had to have the same or very similar grief hallucinations, which is unlikely.",sometimes jesus is described appearing to multiple disciples at once e.g. john 20:19 . each disciple in one of these cases would plausibly have checked with the others that they had also experienced the same thing at the same time.

Support,"if everyone had their own vertical garden, then decentralization would occur. however, in cities, the opposite would be the case. instead of getting food from different farms and sources nationwide, all the food would come from one vertical farm in the center of a city for easy access , which causes dangers of its own.","one central source of food access could increase the risk of the food source not being available due to small issues becoming large ones. for instance, if a disease affects a crop, it'll spread to all the other ones to where there are none left to eat because that was the only place in the city where that crop exists ."
Attack,"if an organisation involves having an understanding of a religion, it is likely that only a member of that religion will have that understanding. therefore, it is legitimate to discriminate in the same way a software company may only hire people with computer science degrees.","there is a significant ethical distinction between discrimination based on an immutable or deeply personal characteristic i.e. religion, race ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, etc. and discrimination based on attainable qualifications."
Attack,"humans are hardwired to empathise and demonstrate these skills from a young age . this is because empathy helps people to associate others with themselves, and build community ties.","the development of empathy may be an unintended side effect of other evolutionary adaptations, like pattern recognition. that does not mean that empathy is vital to humanity's survival."
Support,"it is hypocritical to claim that the movie is letting go of the past by diverging from the previous movie installments, when it is filled with elements from the previous films.","an example of this contrast is the killing han solo being stated as letting go off the past, while having luke milk a hippo shows that it isn't."
Attack,yoga enables you to connect with the source of your creativity .,the source of a person's creativity is a vague term.
Support,"cultural appropriation inhibits minority groups' work to achieve legal ownership and recognition of their culture. it can create a misunderstanding of who owns a culture, leading to cultural erosion.",minorities often struggle to reclaim historically looted art . some items remain within nations with limited links to the source culture outside of colonisation or theft.
Attack,the ability to turn off moral reasoning with transcranial magnetic stimulation does no more to prove that morality is not objective than the ability to turn off physics intuitions would prove that physics is not objective.,physics intuitions can be reliably checked through an experiment external to the subject in question. the same cannot be done to verify morality.
Attack,"neither is political correctness enforced by the government, nor should it be. it's nothing more than a social contract that is in itself subject to public discourse.","a diplomatic government is still created and shaped by its citizens, the more those citizens are themselves shaped by an ideology such as political correctness , the more said government will subsequently begin to be shaped by that same ideology."
Attack,"billionaires are able to fund non profits and be powerful philanthropists, achieving things that other organisations are not able to do.",people can still be philanthropists without being billionaires.
Support,"humans are intrinsically of greater value than other animals, because humans have free will and the ability to choose that which is 'good'.","a value of an animal is measured in what the animal can do or is for a human. some animals are great emotional and spiritual companions, some are delicious food, others are key elements in the animal food chain, etc. in any of these cases, animals can be replaced relatively easy. a human life is irreplaceable, and the benefits another human brings to us are many and important to our well being, protection, companionship, etc."
Support,"a ubi may erode the personal and societal incentives for financial responsibility, self improvement, and hard work; at least for some people.",a ubi would grow people's sense of entitlement and makes it harder for them to see the value of hard work.
Attack,to argue that killing plants is equal to killing animals would enable the argument that cutting the lawn is worse than killing 80 kittens.,"not so. cutting the lawn is not killing any being under normal circumstances. plants exist in a materially different way than animals do, and grass is not killed when it is trimmed, it simply regrows."
Attack,if you save the famous painting you will more likely be in media news and therefore receive the greater benefit from your actions.,a person could also be in the news for trying to save a cat as well.
Attack,"social media sites, such as instagram and facebook , are now clamping down on harmful and pro anorexia content.","even though such groups contravene the rules of these sites, there is often still a short time delay between their inception and their deletion by the platforms moderators or algorithms."
Attack,"worship likely is better translated as make obeisance , as one would to a great king.","whenever biblical figures are described as bowing down and 'proskuneo' in other words, they proskuneo when they are already bowed down , it consistently means worship. this is significant because in some cases righteous people bow down and proskuneo jesus."
Attack,licensing options for open source software are complex.,there are multiple websites dedicated to helping you understand and choose the right license.
Support,"as a species, human beings have proven themselves persistent and adaptable. we are likely to find a way to survive nuclear war, if one ever occurs.",many of the humans may also survive in the shelters built specially for such scenarios.
Support,private companies have the right to remove or ban any users for any reason.,"private companies have no obligation to host anything , for any reason, if they do not want to. that they tend not to abuse this privilege is fortunate; pushing for further limitations is contrary to their rights as private entities."
Attack,direct participation in international institutions increases palestine's lobbying power.,"power within many institutions is likely to be very small; even states like china have a proportionally small voting power share e.g. 4.4 at the world bank, and 6.4 at the imf."
Attack,"companies like exxonmobil are primarily interested in the stability of the region in order to continue their operations, which suggests that they would have little interest in promoting violence.","major oil companies greatly benefit from regional instability in the middle east because it creates a global sense of oil scarcity, increasing the value of oil."
Attack,illegal immigration threatens the security of a nation.,illegal immigrants commit crime at a lower rate than the native population.
Attack,it is more difficult for clinics that offer services both related and unrelated to abortion to accurately account for the utilisation of funds from different sources.,there is no evidence that planned parenthood was using title x funds for abortion related services.
Attack,"teaching a student to feel comfortable in the clothing worn by the powerful, such as formal clothing, encourages them to feel comfortable with success and power.","not everyone aspires to power; noted rich man elon musk is commonly disliked by individuals , and as such, students may not wish to dress like him."
Support,pope francis' changes to the image of the catholic church are solely superficial and reflect no meaningful change.,"restoring original christian values would require revoking the doctrine of papal infallibility , which would make it possible for the roman catholic church to evolve. francis hasn't made such a call, so is not restoring anything of substance."
Support,"they have a constant threat against any organization they join support as they may simply remove their funds if they are doing a bad job, overtly corrupt, or not representative.","using this leverage of their money, name, or volunteer labor, they may make requests of the organization, which they have a clear incentive to give consideration."
Attack,"this implies that most if not all of those in favor of keeping the statues are white supremacists, which is a baseless claim.","it is perfectly consistent with these monuments being used as rallying places for white supremacists, even if most of their supporters are not white supremacists. it is only necessary that some of the supporters be white supremacists. this is uncontroversially the case, as white supremacists themselves attest ."
Support,the film version of the inheritance cycle was particularly underwhelming.,"only one book from the series was made into a movie, which is very disappointing for fans who would like to see all of the books explored in movie format."
Support,trump was a good president in terms of foreign affairs.,trump made more nato members pay their fair share when he took office only 3 of 30 countries were paying their fair share .
Attack,"the indus valley civilization, located in present day pakistan, india, and afghanistan, thrived as a bronze age civilization. it dissapeared due to climate change .","historians believe that the indus civilization didn't solely disappear because of climate change, but also due to lack of social organization: the cities became overcrowded, with houses built on top of houses and people stopped maintaining the drains ."
Support,"the effects of this cruel treatment are twofold. not only does it involve the suffering and murder of billions on an annual basis but also negatively impacts the environment methane and phosphorous outputs, deforestation . ultimately hurting non domestic animal species and ourselves in the process","deontologian ethics support this claim. since slaughter is ultimately an act of violence, it is certain that someone being mean to animals is more likely to act violently against others."
Attack,"there have been many advances in disciplines such as astronomy, physics, mathematics, and ethics that are directly tied to a religious education .","given that education, knowledge, and science were predominantly controlled by the clergy for many centuries, all advances can be traced to them even if they had no direct influence beyond merely holding exclusive administrative powers over public education."
Support,conventional truth and absolute truth are demonstrably different .,individual perceptions and representations of an object are not the thing itself.
Attack,"cricket is a relic of colonialism and reminder of how local people were treated by the british: the latter would bat, while the former bowled for them.","on many different occasions, the indian cricket team defeated the english cricket team in their own home turf. this could be regarded as a way of settling scores on a different terrain and reclaiming the sport as their own."
Support,voters don't need to worry about this possibility if only one of our two legislative bodies is elected through the random ballot.,"the us constitution makes it impossible for a proportional voting system to be implemented in the us senate it is unconstitutional to even pass an amendment that deprives states of their equal suffrage in the senate , so ideally, the us senate would be the deterministically elected legislative body so voters would not have to worry about this."
Support,increased media coverage and public discussion of high and unequal salaries may generate an impetus for change.,public wealth and income information would aid in addressing the gender pay gap .
Attack,"nor that it was the intent of the author of mark, who we assume interview peter, was intent on declaring every miracle ad naseum.",acts of god miracles are always worth relating and hearing and thus can never be done ad nauseam.
Attack,"vaccinations offer proven, fact based, objective health benefits. due to their very nature, the same cannot be said about religious practices.",many religious practices have origins in good health practices.www.huffingtonpost.ca
Support,religion tends to suppress free and critical thinking.,"the dogmatic nature of religion discourages critical thinking, so errors cannot be exposed or debated."
Attack,"it incorrectly teaches that the world has foundations that it rests on: the earth does not rest upon anything but rather is simply in empty space, unsupported and untethered.",the foundations could be interpreted as simply the ground.
Support,people are less likely to trust and cooperate with an abstract and humongous global police force than they are with their national forces.,"police forces are usually strongly identified with the nation and their credibility boosted through national propaganda, which would not be possible with a global police force."
Attack,believing in science does not mean having blind faith it means you can have faith that something will occur knowing that the evidence suggests the outcome.,invoking trust in individuals reduces the argument to personally derived science claims which are often terrible . the rest of the claims in this discussion regard science as a body of human compiled and shared knowledge where we assume consensus is trustworthy.
Support,homeless shelters are generally unsafe for trans women.,"trans women who seek shelter from intimate partner violence don't receive equal protection from staff members at women only shelters and crisis centers, who regard them as a threat to the comfort of survivors and disruptive of the female empowerment model."
Attack,"though prisons have negative side effects, it is important that feminists weaponise a respected system to ensure that people think their issues are legitimate and require action .","carceral approaches to justice often perpetuate harms against minoritised groups, increasing their alienation. this does not remediate the issues it claims to, and may make things worse in the long term."
Support,it would not make sense for people perpetrating a fraudulent messiah to hold to such a conspiracy even up to torturous death,"of the 12 apostles after judas, only the apostle john lived to old age. the others were believed to be martyred."

Support,many people are forced to beg due to structural economic causes such as intergenerational poverty and caste systems.,"in the united kingdom, strict implementation of benefit sanctions , has resulted in more people begging in city centers."
Support,globalisation is only one part of a greater mechanism that is doing this wealth gap spreading.,"budget cuts to education and job losses through digitalization affect people's wages more concretely, especially as the company owners and leaders around the world keep raising their own wages ."
Attack,"moving to a single payer system would negatively affect international healthcare systems, as the us healthcare market essentially subsidizes much of the rest of the world's access to new products and new procedures.",new health related products and procedures do not necessarily lead to better outcomes nor are they inherently less expensive .
Attack,"there is a world ensemble of many concrete universes that exist, actualizing a wide range of possibilities.","if our universe is but one member of a multiverse, then we ought to be observing highly extraordinary events, like horses popping into and out of existence by random collisions, or perpetual motion machines, since these are vastly more probable than all of nature s constants and quantities falling by chance into the virtually infinitesimal life permitting range. observable universes like those strange worlds are simply much more plenteous in the ensemble of universes."
Support,natural selection is a well established scientific fact.,natural selection can be seen in many species. but to define natural selection is important. selection of traits already existant in the animal for the benefit of the species. basically the strongest survive .
Support,monarchs are more effective political figures than elected executives.,the monarch is a permanent diplomatic figure who is respected and appreciated.

Attack,earth's weather systems are too chaotic and complex to allow confidence in long term predictions based only on statistics .,"though the weather is chaotic, the climate is less so , as it is an average of weather patterns over long periods of time. this means that it is easier to spot patterns in the chaotic system."
Support,"forcing them to do otherwise limits the individuality of transgender athletes, which is humanly unjust and infringes on their rights.",prominent organizations like the united nations actively affirm and advocate that transgender rights are human rights.
Attack,"socially and linguistically, trans people face erasure through medical and legal discrimination p. 358 . it is unethical for women only groups to contribute to such discrimination.","there is a modern trend toward more inclusive legislation , representation, and policies."

Support,"some people respond to rising prices by moving to the outer fringes of the city, promoting urban sprawl .","the national population council of australia npc 's population issues committee concludes that, although there is still far more to learn about the links between population levels and environmental impacts, there is some significant evidence of negative influence of urban population growth on urban ecological integrity."
Attack,voters would have the ability to influence the outcome of elections even if their first preferences are eliminated.,"if their first preference is eliminated, their ballot still has an effect on the election, but if a lower ranked candidate is eliminated first, some of their preferences may never be counted."

Attack,it is possible for refugees to be accommodated for in europe without quotas.,europe would have been unable to handle the crisis without a quota system during the initial stages. the situation would have been even more out of control.
Support,this would needlessly provoke the putin regime without offering a significant strategic advantage for democracies.,accepting defecting russian troops or citizens into democratic countries may leave those countries vulnerable to saboteurs.
Support,"some courts, like the pennsylvania supreme court , have refused to consider the petition, deeming it too untenable.",a republican judge on a lower court in pennsylvania delivered a scathing ruling of the trump administration's efforts in court.
Support,approval voting has a history of successful usage.,a limited variant of approval voting was used to elect the first 4 us presidents making it an american tradition.
Attack,minority groups have the ability to challenge government restrictions on speech when they oppose the way they are used.,these groups do not have the necessary political capital to meaningfully challenge restrictive speech bans.
Attack,"eliminating tax deductions and exemptions may require the government to alter tax brackets to ensure fairness in tax liability. this could accentuate a sense of perceived inflation , which can cause people to curtail their purchasing behaviors .",this phenomenon would be fleeting and wouldn't appreciably affect the basic economy.
Attack,"argumentum ad populum refers to appealing to broadly held but false beliefs as a way to assert the truth of those beliefs i.e. most people believe earth is flat, so it must be . this discussion is about people's experience of public spaces and symbolism as the fact itself, not as a way of establishing some other information.","just because it is some people's experience, doesn't mean that it's everyone's experience nor even a majority of people's experiences. to say that slavery was central to everything they are known for is exactly the fallacy argumentum ad populum."
Support,the counter reformation fought back against church corruption.,"the council of trent , a major part of the counter reformation, encouraged ethical practices to curb scandalous practices of high level members of the church."
Attack,it's clear exactly what system leftists want to impose on us when they attribute problems like climate change to the market economy.,it is not clear and it greatly varies and or the name leftist does not apply here.
Support,"on the contrary, a justice system can gain moral force by diverging from the majority opinion of right and wrong.","for instance, even 50 years after the last execution in britain, people still tend to support the reintroduction of the death penalty , by 45 39 . the decision in hindsight has only bolstered the authority of the justice system."
Attack,the tardis uses telepathy to translate languages to the doctor.,"this function is enabled by the tardis' telepathic circuits , which could indicate the presence of timelord created, advanced scientific technology rather than magic that allows for intercerebral connections and translations."
Attack,"there's a risk that this will carve a class system into stone, where the rich enhance their children to so much more able than the children of those who can't afford it that those others can't compete.","there is possibility for a trickle down effect , where when the wealthy are early adopters , it becomes cheaper and more available for everyone unless it's kept exclusive on purpose, which i doubt, because it benefits everyone so much ."
Attack,marriage benefits might be just one type of benefits provided by a government.,the presence of other types of governmental benefits has no bearing on the necessity of marriage benefits.
Attack,"things that exist, but not in any particular place or time as is proposed for god, or its disembodied mind are abstract objects. en.wikipedia.org","the most widely accepted view by philosophers is that an object is abstract if and only if it is non spatial and causally inefficacious. the faculties of the mind depending on how one defines mind are not necessarily causally inefficacious. thus, the faculties of the mind aren t necessarily abstract."
Attack,citizens lack the knowledge and skills to draft good laws.,"no crowdsourced effort uses a simple majority of citizens to resolve conflict, and so the characteristics of the average citizen has nothing to do with the likely success or failure of a crowdsourced effort."
Support,greater choice in healthcare provider does not mean that the delivery of such healthcare itself will result in more personalized care.,many people will not have the financial means to genuinely consider the options available to them on the open market and would instead likely go with the healthcare provider that costs the least.

Support,china is attempting to replace the current international standard of democratic governance as being the key means to success with their more authoritarian model .,"freedom of speech, a key tenant of democratic values, is heavily suppressed in china."
Support,"admiral holdo, for incomprehensible reasons, refused to tell anyone about her plan to evacuate the rebel cruiser, thus sparking the chaotic trip to canto bight.",this seems especially egregious as the rebels thereby keep a plan secret from their best pilot poe that would rely on piloting skills in order to escape the first oder.
Support,"a crowdsourced policy forum would use the same crowdsourcing techniques that are used within the greater crowdsourcing community like wikipedia and github to promote consensus and avoid the type of thinking irrational, biased, and emotional that results in draconian policies.","cowd source facilitation tools and techniques used by organizations like wikipedia and github are low cost, and easily transferable. forum moderation and maintenance techniques that promote quality include user account maintenance with ip tracking, points, karma, and up votes, access levels and moderation seniority, rule enforcement like warning, probation, and banning, and independent peer review."
Support,the soma word group is used to refer to the post resurrection bodies of jesus and believers.,"in colossians 2:9 , paul describes jesus's post resurrection state as dwelling bodily somatikos ."

Attack,the berlin wall was once created as an act of division but its remains are looked upon as signs of unification today.,"the ruins are ruins, not treasured cultural icons represented as heroes."
Support,"history has demonstrated, repeatedly, that any attempt to occupy and 'modernize' afghanistan will result in failure. the soviet union learned this lesson, and now the us nato will.","the mujahideen defeated soviet forces because they were able to embed within the local population, much as the taliban have done."
Support,"as we look about the universe, none of the things that make it up seem to exist necessarily. they could all fail to exist.","if any one of a set can fail to exist, the set itself can fail to exist and so is contingent."
Attack,the tragedy of the commons falsely assumes that all people in a free society act selfishly and in evil ways.,"the indiscriminate depletion of fish in the world s oceans, despite attempts to discourage it, proves that people cannot collaborate selflessly for the greater good."
Support,former conversion therapy organizations have renounced conversion therapy as ineffective.,exodus international renounced conversion therapy.

Attack,"in australia, the penalty imposed for not voting without an explanation is a 20 fine . this is unlikely to be enough to force most people into participating.","while the initial fine is 20 for non compliance with australian voting laws, repeat offenders or those who do not pay are subject to a higher penalty , which will likely have a more persuasive influence."

Attack,"then the extinction risk is near zero in the near and mid future and only distracts from the real problems in the present and near future and more realistic problems in the far future, notably many that do not cause extinction but large loss of life or quality of life.","an actual argument that extinction risk is near zero from human made ai would be nice, and seems required in support of a claim that the statement on ai risk should refer to space aliens instead."
Support,"looking at many of the abrahamic religions will show that the followers tend to stray from good obedience nearly every generation and often in different ways in different generations . god often finds a way to correct certain generations, and that correction is rarely a resetting to an older state but looks somewhat new.","in judaism, there is a lot of generations with different looking patterns of failure and repentance, from those wandering the desert not being abandoned by god to those ruled by judges being saved from enemies a number of times to those ruled by kings and having a temple being given different prophets to give different messages to those who were exiled being allowed to return and build a second temple . the religion evolves but god stays with them throughout."

Attack,"it was a dramatic account that supported what otherwise would merely be articles of faith, namely, that jesus rose bodily from the dead on the third day.","if the intent of the empty tomb stories was to provide drama to the account, we would expect to see a detailed narrative of the resurrection itself jesus leaving the tomb accompanied by all sorts of miracles ."
Support,a main theme of the teachings of jesus is that the hebrews misunderstood their own scripture.,jesus corrects the sadducees on the doctrine of the resurrection quoting a passage from exodus.

Support,"eating meat is not cruel and immoral if the animals that are being consumed are provided with humane living conditions, able to live full lives, and die of natural causes.","merely eating meat isn't cruel. what is cruel is the factory farm system we use to get the meat. if we can get the meat without causing undue pain to the animal, there is no issue."

Attack,"religion is the first evolutionary stage of knowledge development, from religion to philosophy second stage and science third stage , accordingly to comte's law of three stages .","comte presented the scientific stage as the final state, which would allow human knowledge to be perfected, leading to human progress. thus religion becomes anachronism and, since the sciences are well established, it's been inertia for some time."
Attack,"religious based discrimination often just reflected the attitudes of the time, thus other forces, not religion, drove those views.","in postindustrial societies, scholars suggest a connection between modernization and secularization and gender equality. when religious values are weakened, gender equality increases."
Attack,"in the us, only 32 of people believe that animals should enjoy similar rights to humans.","this percentage is up 25 from 2008, showing a substantial increase in the belief that animals should have similar rights to humans. it is likely this upward trend will continue."
Support,"in the absence of adequate penile tissue, surgeons may need to use tissue from other parts of the body , such as the intestine, which can lead to complications. this is best avoided by simply using tissue from a mature post pubertal penis.","alternative procedures can pose unique problems , such as mucus secretions in the case of intestinal vaginoplasty, and increased risk of the vaginal opening closing in the case of mcindoe vaginoplasty, which necessitates life long dilation."

Support,"optics demands that a method show this explicitly in its results, otherwise those who do not know the theory of the voting system will side with the conclusion that the method hurts the majority of voters.",utilitarian methods that use cardinal scored ballots will do this more explicitly than those that use plurality style ballots like approval voting
Support,"by collecting more tax, removing the exemption would allow the us government to receive more income, and allocate more resources to tackling the issues that create a need for charities.",government is in a better position to support vital causes than charities. charities must depend on voluntary contributions while government has the ready resources through taxes.
Support,social media is shown to induce depression in individuals.,"social media can be used as a window into someone's life; yet, no one posts about an average day. all you see is a highlight reel of a person's life . this inevitably causes others to feel inferior."

Support,"meaning is ascribed to things by conscious beings. the first living things were not conscious, so life predates the concept of meaning. therefore life cannot have inherent meaning.","humans can give meaning to life, but life itself has no meaning. humans can for example suffer or enjoy any given moment, therefore meaning is a constant possibility for humans. a biological process what here we call life is not a form of consciousness as we humans know it therefore it cannot make meaning."
Attack,kathy who grow up in a polygamous family thought it was full of jealousy and pain.,"this article barely mentions polygamy outside of the title and opening sentence. the negative experience described here is attributed to kathy's abusive upbringing in the fundamental latter day saints, and has next to nothing to do with polygamy in itself."

Support,"muslims have been drawing on peace, justice, mercy, and tolerance from their scriptures, practices, and norms for 1450 years.","peace is a running theme in islam, that has won the attention of quranic verses, hadith, and the behaviors of the companions of the prophet elements at the basis of islamic culture . one insightful article on this."
Support,"gender neutral bathrooms will likely be designed with greater privacy , due to the mixing of multiple genders. as such, they may better meet the privacy needs of those with medical conditions.","many people try to avoid being heard while using the toilet, for example, by turning on the hand drier or running the tap. as gender neutral bathrooms commonly have floor to ceiling walls, these sound concerns are likely to be reduced."
Support,"if the us government cared about balancing civil liberties with the safety interests of its citizens, then it would have banned the purchasing of firearms. more people have died due to gun related violence, than as a result of terrorism. therefore the government has no moral grounds to decide which civil liberties should or should not be compromised for the purpose of security.","of the 32,000 people shot to death every year, 11,000 are murdered . that's more deaths in a single year than those killed on 9 11."

Support,"bitcoin gives people the power to withdraw their money from government control. people will want to use it, because no one can take it away from them, due to it being completely anonymous. higher and higher taxes will lead to wealthy people trying to escape the government's budget by keeping their money below the radar.","bitcoin's current value is reflecting the value people allocate to it. it is not like fiat currency, a mandatory medium of value exchange controlled by institution business and nationality wise. it is a very important if not the last bastion of the long ongoing revolution. cryptocurrency is not created to substitute fiat currency, it is just a digital decentralized alternative one can use in a digital era, but not have to."

Attack,"palentologists have documented numerous transitional forms and have constructed an astonishingly comprehensive record of the key transitions in animal evolution . conducting a survey of the paleontological literature, one would find that there is abundant evidence for how all the major groups of animals are related, much of it in the form of excellent transitional fossils","if the thesis of common ancestry were correct, we are not talking about there being a few transitional forms like archaeopteryx. rather there should be literally millions and millions of these transitional forms in the fossil record. think, for example, of all of the intermediate forms that would have to exist in order for a bat and a whale to have descended from a common ancestor. and yet, they are not there."
Support,event causal argue that external factors that influence behavior contain a degree of indeterminacy and that free will emerges from that indeterminacy.,"robert kane famously argues that, in truly difficult or strained decisions, there are deterministic forces pulling agents in multiple directions, implying the existence of some indeterminacy ."

Attack,legalising steroid use would benefit intersex athletes.,"this issue could easily be resolved without going to the lengths of legalising performance enhancing drugs. given that the olympics now allows trans women to compete in the women's category without undergoing surgical transition, it seems feasible that rules can be adjusted to allow intersex women to compete as well."

Support,"monarchs, born into a life of privilege and luxury, can't relate to the lives of most of their citizens. being so out of touch makes it harder to rule effectively.","the former king of spain, juan carlos, was criticised for undertaking an expensive and elitist hunting trip during which he shot elephants in botswana at a time when his country was struggling with unemployment and an economic crisis."

Attack,"score and star voting are not much harder to think about, either in concept, implementation, or use, than approval voting.","in terms of concept, score and star more explicitly require the voter to reason on utilitarianism and the nature of utility, and how cardinal numbers express that. this is an entirely new moral and political philosophy and set of concepts for many. compare that to approval, where utilitarianism is only present when a the majority splits the vote between multiple candidates, letting the minority win as familiar in fptp or b a more than majority approved candidate beats a majority favorite."
Support,scientists benefit from making editing wikipedia their hobby.,"they can develop their expertise and be motivated to read more of scientific literature, including literature outside their field of expertise."

Support,many people who come out as lgbtq claim that they knew about their gender identity and sexual orientation from a young age . teaching children such topics will allow them to discover more about their personal identity as they age.,"introducing the concept of gender sooner could help non cisgender students find themselves earlier and, consequently, reduce gender dysphoria ."
Attack,"because girls develop faster than boys, boys may benefit socially by being around their more mature female peers.","the reasons why girls develop faster than boys may be sociological, including gender trauma and gender role expectations . predicating boys' behavior on girls' maturity, therefore, legitimizes such oppressive influences."

Support,capitalism only funds scientific research that can be turned into a profitable product and neglects other researches.,"for example, vaccine for covid19 will be researched by many companies because once done the vaccine will be lucrative. however, the research of vaccine treatment for a rare diseases will not be funded as much because it is not profitable."
Support,"humans will no longer be just human anymore, so the freedoms associated with being human go away. in addition, people have a new body, which has limitations not seen in a human body. thus, people get hit with 2 limitations simultaneously when they become transhuman.","one of these limitations may be robotic body parts breaking down. human bodies continuously fix themselves, whereas robotic parts, once damaged, need to be replaced."

Support,"the government has a role in protecting the most vulnerable members of society, and should actively reduce the stigma surrounding abortion by implementing protest free zones.","setting aside the opinion of abortion, it comes down to providing reasonable protections from damages caused by the menacing behaviors of clinic protestors, whose tactics are meant to cause fear and distress, as well as long term mental and emotional anguish. instituting preventative measures to curtail alarming behaviors is not unreasonable or unusual."
Attack,"the acceptance of the lgbtq community, even across religious countries, is increasing.","even if the acceptance of the lgbtq community is increasing across religious countries, such an acceptance is likely to be quite slow."
Attack,"unrestricted freedom of speech can expose individuals to hateful ideologies, increasing the likelihood that they may be persuaded by them.","recognizing hateful speech is essential for countering it, a task made difficult if it is censored and consequently driven underground."
Attack,"taking retaliatory action against what one perceives as another's misconstrued defense, a defense of which they insist a more enlightened standard would more appropriately deem an offense, could turn out in itself to be nothing but a problematically egocentric action detached from the greater value of social cohesion.","instituting an expectation of inaction, because by one person's imperfect perception of reality may have caused them to be the offending party, and by this expectation we agree that self defense isn't a right, will only lead to people who don't care about offending someone, to offend as many people as possible, since no one is going to defend themselves. therefore some action must be taken."
Support,ndas do affect freedom of speech they literally require signatories to give up their ability to say certain things.,"breaching ndas can cost individuals large amounts of money , therefore ensuring that they continue to abide by them even when they know the information they have ought to be public."

Support,"this puts the responsibility to be safe on the lgbt community, rather than investing in educating the general population.",giving access to self defense training to every member of the lgbtq community won't make much difference in improving their lives as stereotypes will still exist.
Support,it also entitles people to 'reasonable accommodations' to help them work like other employees.,disclosures can allow employees to request for a modification of the management style of their supervisor so it doesn't trigger their mental illness.
Attack,"given that there are so many allocation options, it is likely that there is no perfectly fair system. however, wealth is preferable to the other available factors as it adds to the profitability of a profession, therefore attracting more talent into it.",a judicial system that allocates great lawyers in this way is dangerous as it concentrates both capital derived and judicial power in the hands of the exceptionally wealthy.
Support,the inclusion of gay couples in the institution of marriage is unrelated to a discussion of polygamy.,two people of the same gender marrying cannot be compared to marrying multiple people as they are different situations.
Attack,"research suggests that glyphosate based herbicides could be linked to birth defects , cancer , kidney disease , and non alcoholic fatty liver disease .",several external organisations have found major flaws such as the reliance on animal studies and evidence of unreported non carcinogenic findings in the iarc's study that may significantly affect the conclusions drawn.
Support,"hard drugs heroin, cocaine, or methamphetamine, for example destroy people's lives and those of their families.",it is very unlikely for a person to be functioning or healthy if they are a long term meth or heroin user.
Attack,"the attempt to frame god as sue able would likely illuminate the concept that god is in fact not sue able, following futile attempts to make god legally liable in any actionable way. this futility and its frustration of the legal process would in turn likely disillusion people with religion's role in legal matters sworn testimony, church and state jurisprudence, etc. .",there is precedent that god is suable.4 people who successfully argued with god
Support,many members of royal families now have regular jobs.,"prince constantijn van oranje nassau of netherlands is a part of the international think tank, rand ."

Attack,there is a lack of communication between different peoples that will make it impossible to have every individual in the world speak the same language.,different peoples do not need to talk to each other to implement a global language as long as governments can agree to promote the language within their territories.
Attack,"fewer people would have children under this policy, resulting in a population decrease that would be of practical benefit to many countries.","many countries , including japan, germany, and russia, have declining populations. further limiting the population would exacerbate the problems of labor shortages and overburdened pensions that underpopulation already causes."
Attack,"other paranormal versions of existing existential risks could be described as making extinction risk more applicable , such as a zombie virus pandemic. we similarly do not refer to the zombie apocalypse when discussing existential risk from pandemics, so ignoring alien ais is normal and expected.","extraterrestrials are not paranormal . indeed, they are not only plausible but also feasible to be able to have come here."
Attack,"people's privacy and safety is better protected if e.g. medical professionals and non profit organizations drive ai development and deployment, not commercial interests. open source enables that.","as of january 2025, the default deepseek model if not run locally behind a firewall appears to send information to china ."

Support,"the fundamental principles of islam as found in the quran, hadith and other sound sources oppose western principles.","freedom of religion is a fundamental western principle. in islam, it's not. in for example the qur'an, surah 5:33 , opposers of islam are to be killed or crucified."

Support,ai technologies would not be possible if training on copyrighted works was not allowed . this would mean that intangible copyright that is not clearly prohibited would prevent the legal adoption of the most practical possible technology.,"if such principles were consistently applied in the past, humans would still live in the stone age given that designs and or formulations such as clothing, medicine, construction or weapon could have been intellectual property where copyright was unclear or where others were not permitted to implement these. copyright , as it stands , already seems outdated and inhibitive to many."
Support,"cultural appropriation is often a misrepresentation of the appropriated cultures, which imparts incomplete or inaccurate understandings.",western practices of yoga often strip spirituality from the act making it significantly different to the original intended practice.
Support,"france, china, and russia are among countries reported to also investigate ufos and to have had numerous peculiar uap incidents.","a semi official iranian news agency claimed the u.s. is secretly run by nazi aliens since around 1945 . in 1976, a radar corroborated ufo sighting occurred in tehran . according to nsa documents , a foreign forum feature described the case where iranian air force jets and a ufo played cat and mouse , with the uap appearing on radar and 'paralyzing' their weapons and electronics systems when the jets attempted to open fire on it . there are further ufo reports from the country, such as from 2007 ."

Support,"schooling teaches children self discipline ; if school is not mandatory, only those lucky enough to have disciplined parents will gain this skill.","students can be inclined to play truant ; without mandatory schooling, the causes of truancy are unlikely to be remediated, leading to a loss of student self discipline and poor learning outcomes."
Attack,research has shown that brain drain actually has a positive effect on the country of origin.,"much research indicating possible positive effects of a brain drain does not necessarily vouch that it is net beneficial or that there are no negative effects, but rather that the negative effects can be exaggerated ."
Support,the contradictions pointed out in the bible have been criticized as a misinterpretation of the context of the text.,many apparent contradictions arise because individual verses in the bible are taken out of context and compared to each other in a vacuum.
Attack,one can define god as the thing that most resembles less accurate or untrue definitions of god for example if there is no all powerful then we can say he is the entity closest to all powerfulness.,"it's possible to do this with the definition of any supernatural creature; it's also facile. unicorn by this method might get you an ordinary horse, or a narwhal, but either way someone who exclaimed unicorns exist! would be pointlessly confusing because neither creature is what the word unicorn refers to."
Attack,"if the assertion that these religious texts did in fact originate outside of humanity, then we have a basis for a shared morality that is objective.","there are several religious texts which assert a moral position that is in contradiction to another religious text's position. this would perpetuate the battles for religious supremacy which has lead to millions of deaths, which has been seen as moral bad."
Attack,"if all citizens are required to vote, there will be an incentive for politicians to appeal to the largest group of people, and thus be more moderate.",more moderate policies are not necessarily more representative of people's interests and views.
Attack,"this has always been a point of the star wars movies: any individual can reach greatness, independent of where they come from and who their parents are. the decision to not care about rey's origin only emphasizes this.","provided said individual is force sensitive, which has always been beyond the individual's control."

Attack,"puberty should, by default, be delayed, until a person chooses otherwise.","delaying puberty universally would not be consistent with the principles of evidence based public health policy, as there is not yet sufficient evidence on the risks posed by puberty blockers p. 3 ."
Support,"having black skin is a physical characteristic, not an aspect of culture. so, while it can be used to create harmful stereotypes, blackface isn't cultural appropriation.","skin colour is determined by genetic factors , as opposed to external factors such as clothing styles or cultural practices, which have evolved within communities over many years."
Attack,president trump consistently created a bad image of america and its citizens by tweeting unpresidential statements.,"the 'storm' was created by the media frenzy, not the tweet itself. the bias of the media necessitated direct communication with the electorate and the world."

Attack,"as a melting pot of cultures, it is appropriate that americans celebrate holidays that represent the diversity of its people.","cinco de mayo is not about the diversity of america. therefore, regardless of whether the concept of america being a melting pot is accurate or not and if that justifies celebrating other cultures' holidays, this argument is irrelevant."

Support,"in the process of the canonisation of saints, a vatican representative is appointed as the devil's advocate . this person is required to attempt to disprove miracles attributed to candidate saints by finding other ways to explain the events.","scientific evidence would have been provided against any miraculous works during the canonization process . that evidence was either insufficient, lacking in credibility, or ineffective at disproving the miraculous works because sainthood was still given to those who were said to have practiced miracles."
Attack,"if carrying a symbol such as a pride flag would be permissible, so by the same token, religious symbols should be permitted.","there is no guarantee that a pride flag, which can be considered controversial, would be permitted either."

Attack,"a homo sapien fetus is human, therefore a fetus has human rights at least. among the inalienable human rights is the right to life.","by law, a human is a person. therefore, a fetus cannot be considered a human being because it has not yet developed into one; it is only potential."
Attack,"intersex people constitute a very heterogeneous group of people with diverse sexual characteristics and conditions , evidencing that sex cannot be categorised into a binary.","less than 2 of the population is intersex. this figure is too small to warrant a change in how sex is conceptualized and classified, when its established definition adequately accommodates 98 of the population."
Attack,"by this logic, experiences with the physical are simply experiences interpreted a certain way. they aren t necessarily real because there can be no evidence for the reliability of our five senses. believing they are reliable is properly basic. therefore, there can be no evidence the physical is real either.","by that logic how can you tell when you are awake vs when you are dreaming? the dream world seems to be the product of sense data. but we know which is real and which is the hallucination. it's the same with the so called supernatural senses. we know it's the hallucination, not the reality, the same way."
Attack,how the animals are raised does not affect the conversion ratio of the calories of plants they consume to the calories of meat they provide. using farmed animals as a food source is inherently inefficient.,"how the animals are raised does not affect the conversion ratio of organisms on different trophic levels, but it does have an impact on the overall efficiency on a farm. the claim that animals inefficiency is a zero sum outlook on farm production, which only holds true for certain kinds of agriculture. in systems based agriculture an animal is one part of the system, using inputs e.g. grass , but creating inputs for other parts of the system e.g. manure . this can be highly efficient."
Support,such species became extinct simply by process of natural selection. to de extinct them would be to go against the laws of nature.,"many species went extinct via natural selection , or may have even disappeared long before humans arrived on earth."

Attack,"military expenditure would decline, allowing other areas to flourish.",there may still be a need for global scale military spending in a one world state context.
Attack,"such a law could be abused as it inherently targets the bodies of people who have the ability to birth children. as such, it significantly affects women more than men.","if raising children requires social resources beyond that which the mother can provide on her own, then it is fair to demand basic maternal competence in return for access to those resources."
Support,many viewers think the educational quality of tv shows is generally poor.,many programmes are described as documentaries even though they are fictional .
Attack,"it is conceptually possible for anyone to value anything. even if the only thing that someone valued was the number of blades of grass they had stepped on, there is no way we could scientifically prove to them that they are wrong about what to value.",maximizing the well being of conscious creatures is the only thing we can reasonably value.
Support,"president trump moved the us embassy to jerusalem , which was a bold move to strengthen america's global standing.",moving the us embassy showed that the us is truly committed to peace in jerusalem there would be no reason to place us ambassadors in jeopardy otherwise.
Attack,the bible mentions that jesus was crucified after the passover meal while simultaneously mentioning that jesus died before the passover meal.,"the bible refers to time depending on who the audience was, with regards to the timing of certain events. therefore , mark mentions time by jewish reckoning, whereas john uses roman time throughout his gospel."

Attack,"celebrities breaking gender norms is not a recent phenomenon. kurt cobain, freddie mercury, david bowie, and prince are just a few examples of iconic musicians who blurred gender boundaries related to fashion and clothing.","social media has made celebrities and their private lives more visible. this makes their defiance of gender norms feel more authentic and inherent, and less orientated in performance and show business."

Support,"saddam said that the u.s did not need to invade iraq to obtain control of iraq's oil supply, and just prior to the invasion was ready to sign a deal giving the u.s priority over other nations. the fact that bush who certainly had a conflict of interest regarding the oil industry rejected this offer leads to the conclusion that control of iraqi oil by u.s oil companies was not a serious consideration for the bush adminstration's justification for the war.",journalist muhammad idrees ahmad stated that gulf energy resources have always been a vital us interest. on no other occasion has the us had to occupy a country to secure them.

Attack,"via the bibliographic test, the internal test, and the external test the bible is examined and found to be a reliable document from the first century.","significant events in the gospels have significantly different accounts. john does not describe any extraordinary events during the death of jesus. matthew claims that there was an earthquake, fabric tore on it's own and the dead rose from their graves. these inconsistencies discredit the claims that the bible can be considered reliable for major events, let alone minor events."

Attack,"if everyone is forced to help the poor to some degree, the burden is shared with everyone in society. erasing force completely creates a higher burden on a less amount of people. this is, a self sustaining spiral, such as which create and force governments to subsidize high risk insurance pools .","everyone being forced to help the poor to some degree is the entire point of the welfare system. in practice, this duty falls to the government because it is the only institution with coercive power over every citizen."
Attack,the monarch used to appoint the formateur i.e. the politician whose job it is to form a coalition government after general elections and is still involved in the process.,"however, legislative changes in 2012 have removed the monarch from this task and it is now performed by the house of representatives. the responsibilities of the monarch are therefore increasingly minimised."

Attack,"the account explicitly refers to the stolen body theory matt 27:64, 28:13 15 , bringing attention to it in an obvious attempt to preclude it and denounce it. these are exactly the details we'd expect to see if the story were an apologetic designed to refute the theory.","this implies that both pro resurrection thinkers and anti resurrection thinkers, would have been aware of the doctrine of resurrection. so even if this is indicative of designed refutation, someone had to raise the objection, proving that jesus did get crucified, was buried, and was claimed to have risen on the 3rd day."
Attack,"much of the west has its own system of separating people. while not as explicitly as cast, class divides can still divide people for their entire life , prevent marriages , and trap people for generations .","class divides based on income are rooted in capitalism not secularism, and can affect secular and religious countries equally ."

Support,you don t have to be a main disciple to expect a dead person to rot. the expectation of a dead person rotting by any party would be assumed if they had taken his body and prepared it for burial properly.,"it is implausible that joseph of arimathea, the disciple of jesus, would not have realized that jesus would be resurrected if the apostles realized that."

Attack,"god's commands to us are expressions of his will, but are rooted in the divine nature. god's essential moral properties like justice, kindness, compassion, truthfulness, and so forth aren t arbitrary. they can t be changed. they are logically necessary and therefore exist in all possible worlds.","immutable doesn't imply logically necessary nor non arbitrary. the latter is a non sequitur with respect to the former. namely, immutable is a property with respect to time, whereas the other two are with respect to possible worlds."
Support,"a right is a social agreement contract, and as such is only meaningful if it is enforced. if the agreement between moral actors is not respected by all parties to the social contract, then it is not truly a right . this demonstrates that a right requires a choice to agree to behave a certain way.","freedom in a modern sense is a legal term. it means what one may do without impediment, with legal recourse to remove impediments. before laws, there were no freedoms as such, only what one could do or get away with doing such is the case still today ."

Attack,the public should be able to view the behavior of their elected officials on social media and judge it for themselves.,"the public can judge politicians for themselves when they are being properly informed, not in situations where lies and facts are intermingled, which is the case of politicians like donald trump . in these cases, people's judgement will be compromised."
Attack,"in the united states, the people control the government. if the majority of people want to have a monument in their town, and are willing to pay for it, no one should be able to say otherwise.",this ignores the individuals who do not want the monument and are still forced to pay for it.
Support,scholars point out that there was no roman census that required that people travel from their own homes to those of their distant ancestors. as claimed by luke.,"bethlehem was the home of david, who lived around the year 1000 bce. joseph was living in the first century ce. it's inconceivable that anyone would be expected to know about and return to the home of their ancestor from a millennium prior."
Attack,sexual predators could take advantage of inclusive policies by posing as members of a different gender in order to gain access to these facilities and harm others.,"although women tend to be more cautious around strangers, most sexual assaults are carried out by men who are already close to the victim, such as intimate partners p. 450 ."

Attack,"insect resistance genes can be inserted into crops from other species, negating the need for insecticide whilst also protecting crops.","it is important to keep a balance between insect resistant gm crops and non gm crops in order to avoid selection pressure , causing surviving insects with natural immunity to modified genes to mate with each other and increase the likelihood that future generations will also inherit the same immunity."

Support,"since 80 of republicans trust trump more than the media, there is little risk that trump's credibility will be affected by accusations of misinformation.","in 2018, 91 of self identified strong trump supporters said they trusted trump for accurate information, compared to 11 who trusted mainstream media."
Support,"in god's final speech to job wherein he refutes job's theology, god did not acknowledge that he was the one behind job s suffering. rather, he appeals to factors in creation to explain why job cannot understand his suffering.","the fact that god attacks job's theology at all, which at numerous points asserts that god is responsible for his ills e.g. job 24:12 , indicates that this is not an accurate understanding of god's role in the creation of suffering."
Attack,"taking offense may be a learned behavior from a society that wears clothes exclusively, where public nudity is often sexual or threatening. this can be unlearned.","public nudity is often meant to cause offense and punishment. in both historic and modern times, it has been used as a punishment meant to warn others of the consequences for wrong doing."
Support,a part of what we find enjoyable in food is what we are used to. if we change to vegetarian food we will become accustomed to those flavours and meat would seem less appealing.,"it would be easier to grow up on a vegetarian or vegan diet than to have to learn later to like substitutes, once acquired tastes have been acquired."
Support,"most people are drawn to news that already agrees with them . rather than expecting people to use more sources, the focus should be to ensure that the sources they already use are factual.","people prefer news that they agree with because they are looking to confirm the beliefs they already hold, this phenomenon is known as confirmation bias ."

Support,applying the concepts of good and evil to god is nonsensical.,the existence of god does not require the belief of man nor would such a supreme being require the adherence to man's constructs of good and evil as such a being operates outside of time and space.
Attack,economies that lean more heavily towards socialist policies generally have higher tax rates compared to their more capitalist counterparts. this means real wages are much lower regardless of the initial salary.,"because countries with high tax rates have very progressive tax codes, the difference between real wages and pre tax salary will be less pronounced among the lowest incomes and more pronounced among higher incomes. this will tend to decrease income inequality, which will grow real wages on average, irrespective of tax wages."
Attack,animal testing is critical for toxicology research that benefits humans and animals.,the two most popular toxicity tests subject animals to intense pain and suffering.
Support,it is a country's right as a sovereign nation to self govern and thus decide against helping those who are not its citizens or residents.,"the united nations charter upholds the westphalian principle that each state is the exclusive sovereign of its territory, stating that the united nations cannot intervene in matters which are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of any state."
Attack,"god is a figment of human imagination, and is therefore no more real than fire breathing dragons and pink unicorns. pre scientific, pre industrial people who knew less than we do made up supernatural i.e. fake explanations based on superstition which were exaggerated over time.","saying that god is a figment of imagination is not evidence for or against the existence of god, it is an unsupported claim. naming the past possible creation of the claim suggested is no more support of the claim then the claim its self."
Support,"the belief in the theory of a patriarchy that there is some cabal of men shaping society is ludicrous, and not to mention insulting to the great women in history who had a hand in shaping the modern world.","feminists often make up inequalities that don t actually exist such as the wage gap , male privilege , rape culture etc."

Attack,the foreskin has several functions all of which are lost when it is removed.,"most of these functions are based on its ability to prevent types of infections though, circumcised males are generally less exposed to penile infections . so the functions are more like 'worse versions of the same functions as those of circumcised penises', which makes this argument irrelevant."

Attack,"it is important to think of reform not in terms of beating other reforms, as this is counterproductive and helps opponents of all reforms.","this is true to some extent, but producing consensus and strong preference for one or related reforms is better than having disunity, as voters who don't pay attention can't briefly summarize what to go with or why, to themselves and to others."

Support,"uniforms play a very important role in maintaining school discipline , a vital skill for students to learn.","students who wear uniforms are less focused on what they themselves and others are wearing, and so are more focused on the academic side of school."
Attack,the mere fact that marriage benefits those who participate in it does not mean it should be extended to everyone.,"the original claim does not specify this as a reason for extending such protections. it could be the fact that human rights and equality oriented societies generally wish to extend protections and benefits to as many persons as possible that is relevant, here."
Support,"an ai might not even have the concept of self preservation , which is derived in biological organisms from the need to replicate.",ai lacks a concept of self and cannot therefore have the goal of self preservation.
Support,"at least three agencies investigating the subject with access to some classified or nonpublic information came to the conclusion that the lab leak hypothesis is the most likely: the u.s.' fbi , and u.s.' department of energy as well as germany's spy agency bnd . in 2025, the cia considers the lab leak more likely.",bnd investigations suggested wuhan researchers carried out gain of function experiments and that there had been numerous violations of safety regulations at the lab.
Attack,presidents jefferson and washington would not be considered good people by today's standards. very few people celebrate them for committing crimes and faux pas which had yet to be invented.,"the standards of the days of the civil war were understood by the people living in the time. freedom was for all men. it was debatable leading up to the civil war, but the context was just that: debatable. the south took up arms to justify their position. all warring factions may think they are justified, but its unreasonable to maintain a legacy in statue when the country and the constitution knew they were wrong."

Attack,"not all mental shortcuts are stereotypes. if someone looks like a woman, then you are right to assume that that person is a woman.","all mental shortcuts based on perceptions experiences are stereotypes. stereotypes are not bugs in our cultural software but features of our biological hardware. this is because the ability to stereotype is often essential for efficient decision making, which facilitates survival...you don t ask a toddler for directions, you don t ask a very old person to help you move a sofa, and that s because you stereotype. an assumption that a person is a woman is based on their looks is stereotyping."
Attack,islamic feminism seeks to accommodate women within the patriarchy rather than seeking to entirely abolish the patriarchy pp. 58 59 .,"some forms of feminism, such as lean in feminism , strive to compromise and coexist within antithetical systems, like corporate capitalism. such compromises can equally be made with other patriarchal systems."

Support,"transhumanism could speed up human evolution, which provides multiple benefits.","speeding up evolution could fill in the gaps of evolution that only got us so far , such as eliminating genetic diseases."
Support,the concept of the god of classical theism is incoherent because within the attributes of god contradict each other and they also contradict our experience of the universe.,"the classical god promises an eternal life after death, but could equally as well provide an eternal life with no death, or two way communication between the living and unliving, which would better serve the goals of the classical god."

Support,"some may argue that evidence that could be called somewhat unambiguous exists but is not taken seriously and that there hasn't been a large effort and or willingness to gather, verify, and or declassify such evidence.","according to graves and others, reporting systems for uap incidents currently and especially historically are highly suboptimal, neglected, and used only little. there is lots of data that relates to uap that is known to both a exist and b not be public."
Support,"complex ideas are more likely to receive fud and paralysis, due to the greater amount of time and effort required to understand them and their implications.","all else equal, a more popularly used and observable method beats a less used method; this is one of the cruxes of why people and organizations resisted star voting in lane county."
Support,"in a 5 4 decision by the supreme court, the court established that providing a forum for speech was not enough to constitute a non profit operating a public access channel, as a state actor and mandate free speech rights.","social media does not do more than provide a forum for speech, and so even though the judgement did not explicitly mention social media, it can be reasoned that social media platforms would not come under the first amendment."

Support,the two aims or directions are not mutually exclusive. some ways of lowering dependency on fossil fuels would also reduce dependency on finite rare earth resources.,"dependency on fossil fuels is lowered in a transport transition that shifts the modal share from personal fossil fuel cars to electric public transport, muscle powered bicycles, and walking as well as reducing some travel, for example through remote work or critical evaluation if the travel is truly needed. due to much higher resource efficiency, less finite rare earth resources are required."

Attack,"while the conception of god as omnipotent, omniscient and omnibenevolent may be 'traditional' in philosophical discussions of monotheism, it is not necessarily supported by the actual scriptural traditions of abrahamic monotheism.","the contradiction identified in this claim is contained in the bible itself. evidently, the texts that describe god's character contradict themselves."

Attack,"some parents may consider it their ethical obligation to reduce the likelihood of their children being distracted by the opposite sex . in this regard, sex segregation is more ethical.","sexual development begins at a very young age . school policy and parental decisions should, therefore, nurture this developmental process, rather than stifle it through the imposition of purity culture and outdated sexual morality."

Attack,"it is not clear that he gives in to rage or hatred, but that his conclusion that palpatine is sith and beyond redemption, and cannot be safely apprehended, so has to die, might be flawed, and is certainly at odds with what anakin wants. if anything, it is anakin that is not thinking clearly, as he is thinking only of his own desires and not the bigger picture.","while not explicitly clear, it is insinuated as windu uses the reasoning of the sith too dangerous to be kept alive to break the jedi code and attempt to kill an 'unarmed' man."
Attack,"humans are unable to understand what makes a work of art be it a song, a novel or a painting, etc. successful, since it entails more than just technique, therefore it is unlikely ai art could just surpass human art.","as humans are unable to understand what makes a work of art successful, they may start recognising any creation made by ai as art. this means ai may end up supplanting humans in creating art just because people think ai can create something even if it actually can't create art."

Attack,"this increased expenditure by the united states' system has resulted in its patients being more satisfied with healthcare, as compared to patients in countries with a government controlled system, such as germany and canada.","it is unclear if public opinion is directly correlated with the actual efficiency of the system. us citizens have in most cases not experienced healthcare systems in other countries, and hence cannot make a comparison, nor does the average citizen have the required information to deliver informed opinions about the state of healthcare."

Support,a longer life expectancy may indicate a more responsible lifestyle.,"in the us, the life expectancy gender gap is 6.7 years, indicating that women are much more responsible than men."
Support,unobserved events with no experimental backup are only philosophical ideas.,a theory may sound scientific but without experimental backup is really philosophy based on assumptions.
Support,there are government and charity organisations whose sole purpose is to protect children from abuse and neglect. schools are not necessary to this end.,child protective services respond to cases of child neglect and abuse and are responsible for ensuring the safety of children.
Support,"with the rise of the internet, manufacture of firearms is easier, and the knowledge of doing so is much more accessible. therefore, reserving firearms for law enforcement or soldiers is increasingly difficult.","3d printing has allowed for people to easily manufacture their own firearms , circumventing many legal controls."
Support,this would require additional funds to ensure that teachers are trained to utilize technology and incorporate digital platforms in their curriculum.,digital literacy courses for k 8 classroom teachers can cost up to 395 usd per teacher per course .
Support,"when a merger happens, it is likely that one company may lose all of its power, which can lead to instability between the 2 companies. this seeds general instability in markets.","mergers and acquisitions are often cloaked in secrecy . this can significantly erode employee trust in their employer, lead to a perceived lack of transparency, and create an us vs. them bias."
Support,many political systems are currently limited in their ability to take significant action. those in power benefit from the status quo and fighting climate change decreases their profits.,"any global solution will divide the world against china, as it currently contributes the most towards global emissions and may need to continue doing so, even if through offshored projects."
Attack,innocent civilians are victims of putin's attack on ukraine.,innocent civilians are always a victim of war. this has no bearing on whether the war is justifiable or not.
Attack,"some intolerance is necessary in order to create a tolerant society; a group that sets no hard boundaries is likely to find itself undermined. as such, it is legitimate for feminists to occasionally deplatform others.",it is hypocritical for ostensibly open spaces to refuse entry to some based on their political views ; such actions may have a greater chilling effect than any dissent that could otherwise occur.
Attack,the us has historically criticized high executive pay and promised to constrain corporate greed. following through on this promise would improve the international and domestic credibility of us politicians.,"with the introduction of salary caps, american companies would become a symbol for a practice that many international business people will consider harmful and want to avoid."
Support,some of the events in the movie were overtly politicized with respect to the present day. these didn't really serve the plot and instead broke the illusion of star wars being a unique universe quite different to our own.,the movie took a critical stance towards weapons manufacturers and sellers.
Support,"regulation takes the focus off of the actual perpetrators of fake news, and places disproportionate responsibility on social media platforms.","regulation would shift focus onto social media sites, and disregard the rampant polarization and poor behaviour online."
Attack,gender identities have already moved away from typical definitions and constructions of gender.,"recent changes to the definitions of gender and gender identity more accurately represent the fact that they are socially and individually constructed; previously, these terms were considered synonymous to sex ."
Attack,"the infinity gauntlet , the ultimate tool for molding the universe. marvel",most beings are unable to withstand the power of using the gauntlet more than once.
Attack,governments are obligated to improve and maintain citizens' quality of life. introducing parenting licenses would help facilitate this.,"the responsibility to maximise quality of life lies with the individual, not the state."
Attack,"the choices made available by planned parenthood, such as abortion , can cause women psychological trauma .","abortion will prevail regardless. planned parenthood decreases the likelihood of women choosing dangerous , at home abortion methods, or risking serious complications from an unwanted live birth , both of which can be far more damaging than the psychological effects of abortion."
Support,religious dogma can block the exploration of personal spiritual development.,faith is a closed ended inquiry. no learning is possible if you already decided the answer beforehand.
Attack,gender quotas that do not drive selection of candidates based on competency or accomplishment are unjust.,women are not currently given equal opportunities based on merit in the work place.
Support,the fact that many prominent pro life organizations are run by women makes it unlikely that the pro life movement is anti woman.,the president of the pro life organization susan b. anthony's list is a woman.
Support,characterising the actions of new atheists that mock or belittle religious belief as aggressive attacks is inaccurate as it implies violence rather than ridicule.,new atheists routinely argue against the use of violence by religious groups.
Support,counting ranked choice ballots would take more time and place an unaffordable burden on polling officials and volunteers.,"rcv is not precinct summable, which means that all ballots need to be transferred to a central location for counting, rather than counting them in each district and transmitting only the totals."
Attack,"according to hitchens's razor , what can be asserted without evidence can also be dismissed without evidence and the burden of proof lies on those claiming there is something there.","this is merely an adage and not a reasonable well explained methodology. one also needs to consider likelihoods, cumulative data, and so on instead of just dismissing without engaging and sufficiently looking it."
Attack,"it is more likely that the rebellion would make putin desperate to reassert himself, which makes him more dangerous .","the fact that putin did not prosecute anyone from the wagner group, despite initially promising harsh punishment, suggests his limited political capital on this issue."
Attack,there is insufficient bayesian evidence for a historical jesus .,the existence of a historical figure is not dependent on statistical likelihood but on historical and archaeological evidence.
Attack,many cities lack viable tourist attractions for families with young children; zoos are certainly the most popular .,the most popular children's attractions in the us are amusement parks.
Attack,there is a large diversity for example in the alien beings even when the abduction procedure seems similar as in the case of the first encounter of huggins or the pascagoula abduction .,"some people have claimed there is a large number of aliens. it's possible many of them engage in similar practices. alternatively, they could be created grown by some superintelligence and or the given society."
Support,it will not have been worth the sacrifice if we destroy the earth or a multitude of species go extinct before we get to an alien planet.,many humans could die before humanity's ability to spread life to other worlds becomes realised.
Attack,bullying is one of the principal reasons parents remove their children from traditional schooling and begin homeschooling.,bullying by siblings or even parents can occur in homeschooling situations as well.
Support,the literal resurrection in matthew 27:52 53 was regularly defended by early church fathers .,"clement of alexandria c. ad 155 200 wrote but those who had fallen asleep descended dead, but ascended alive. further, the gospel says, that many bodies of those that slept arose, plainly as having been translated to a better state alexander roberts, ed. stromata, ante nicene fathers, vol. ii, chap. vi, 491 ."
Attack,"incidents such as a governor who in his youth dressed up as blackface to a costume party , a nobel laureate who argued his entire life that black people are genetically inferior , government authorities who separate young children from their illegal immigrant parents and law enforcement agents who shot a good guy with a gun just because he was black triggered just about the same level of outrage.","the positive perspective on this is that the more issues get public attention, the more issues get a chance to be resolved, especially those that would previously have been deemed too minor."
Attack,"some people have positive experiences when they are open about their sexuality; therefore, a homosexual orientation may be attractive to some.",most gay people find it difficult to tell their parents when they grow up .
Attack,"in practice, it is unlikely individuals will be prosecuted if they are genuinely unable to get hold of masks due to supply shortages.","the excuse of supply shortages is only sufficient if they have no choice but to leave their homes. yet if they could have remained at home but chose not to, then they are still choosing to break the law, irrespective of their reasons for not wearing a mask. given this, they can and should be prosecuted still."
Support,rape jokes can trigger painful memories of sexual assault in survivors.,"given the high number of people who have experienced sexual assault, rape jokes have the capacity to trigger painful memories in a significant number of people."
Attack,hinduism accepts other religions as valid and beneficial spiritual paths.,"if all religions are right, then there is no standard to measure truth other than by feelings and emotions."

Support,"the existence of evil can be reconciled with an all powerful, all knowing and all loving god. god would not want to remove evil if a greater good were only achievable with the existence of evil.","according to the character building defenses , some virtues are contingent on evil. this shows that the existence of evil is not entirely bad itself."
Support,"the underlying driver of science is human curiosity, which is not established by religion, but only flavored by it.","according to the philosopher david hume , religion is a product of our sensible nature. therefore religion might also be the product of human curiosity, not the drive."
Attack,a census to return to your home is not requiring someone to know 1000 years of heritage. this is red herring.,"bethlehem wasn't joseph's town but david's : 4 so joseph also went up from the town of nazareth in galilee to judea, to bethlehem the town of david, because he belonged to the house and line of david. however, david lived 1000 years before joseph."
Support,"what constitutes a great making property is to some degree debatable . for example, is it greater to be timeless or omnitemporal? the answer is not clear. but our uncertainty as to what properties the greatest conceivable being must have does nothing to invalidate the definition of god as the greatest conceivable being. here anselm s intuition which you mention seems on target: there cannot by definition be anything greater than god.",the concept of the greatest conceivable being is not the same as the concept of the greatest imaginable being. no advocate of perfect being theology thinks that god is a being whose properties are contingent upon human cognition.
Attack,circumcision is considered far more aesthetically pleasing to many men and their partners and they should not be forced to live with embarrassment of non circumcision.,"no man is forced to live with the embarrassment of non circumcision , adult circumcision is an option for men who wish they had been circumcised."
Attack,"all caused things must have a cause. since an eternal regression of causes requires that the sum of all existence, as a whole, to be uncaused, and a finite regression of causes requires that the start of the regression be uncaused, it is necessary that an uncaused cause exists.","even if you were granted validity to the cosmological argument, you still must prove that the uncaused cause is an intelligence with agency. even then you've still done nothing to prove the existence of a particular god."
Support,"the infection mortality rate of covid 19 is only 1.4 , as of may 2021.","there are many causes of death which, in an average year, kill more people than covid 19 has."
Attack,"compared to men, there are next to no female leaders. therefore, the studies cannot be representative.","while there is still a lot more leaders who are men, there has been and currently are, a lot of female leaders."
Attack,"while it is possible that work on two different cause areas might have exactly the same expected value, this is unlikely enough to be prima facie implausible.","there is an imprecision involved that makes exactly 'the same value' possible. if 5 people jump across 10 fields until the music stops, it is not unlikely 2 of them will stand on the same field. this is the case here but could change with newer data or changes in regards to mitigation."
Support,"it does not follow that because countries legislate against theft, capitalism does not incentivize theft.","many negative actions incentivized by capitalism are legislated against e.g. pollution of the air and water, abuse of workers, fraud, etc ."
Attack,"oxford oriental institute professor, dr. young hae chi , citing dr. david jacobs, claims aliens are breeding with humans and 'spawning new generations of alien human hybrids as a reaction to climate change and nuclear weapons'.",the explanation for the hybridization program is absurd. humans may not be well adapted but it would be too late and humans can still withstand climate change in various ways such as via relocating or staying in ventilated indoor areas of cities protected with climate change adaptation measures.
Support,"the responsibility to maximise quality of life lies with the individual, not the state.","people have different views of what makes for a good life, so state intervention should only intervene in ways that maximize their options for their lives, leaving exclusive control over an individual's choices to the individual themselves."
Support,historical war and strategy games allow players to experience events in history first hand.,the sid meier s civilization game series can be used in multiple ways to teach students history and social studies.

Attack,"automatons are expected to experience some form of decay. after enough time, be it a few hundred or millions of years, nature could have reclaimed these machines, thus also destroying data.","they could be modular and swap out their technological organs at regular intervals and these could be made highly durable, such as via nanobots that maintain material integrity and so on."
Support,evidence suggests that quotas at the top level do not help women at lower levels of the corporate hierarchy.,women in positions of power often see women underneath them in the corporate hierarchy as a threat and so have little incentive to support them.
Attack,"by destroying the iconography memorializing history, we forget history. those ideologies, if even they were wrong, are doomed to repeat.","if history's lessons are in part to not repeat the mistakes, then the divisive nature of our political discussions about this topic or in general are a sign that the statues' value in reminding us of such a course seems ineffective, rendering the reminders of our past argument somewhat mute."
Support,other measures can be instituted in tandem with travel bans.,timely travel restrictions can boost the impact of other measures on flattening the curve of infections .
Support,"the migration of a variety of people increases mutual cultural tolerance, understanding, and respect , contributing to a more open minded and compassionate population.","in a study conducted in 2006 in all 50 us states, americans living in areas with higher percentages of immigrants were more likely to recognise the positive contributions of immigrants than those living in areas with fewer immigrants."
Attack,the majority of muslims believe that abortion is morally wrong.,"islamic belief postulates that a foetus becomes a living soul after around four months of gestation, suggesting that abortion becomes impermissible after that point."
Support,"there is a difference between logical necessity, which may require an omniscient perspective, and the necessary restrictions imposed by one's composition.","it is not logically necessary for an organism to eat, but eating is vital for its survival."
Attack,hbo's original programming is already delayed due to the hollywood writers' strike. a massive new venture could delay this programming even further.,it is going to be easier to adapt harry potter compared to new projects since the source material is largely already available and fan fiction has provided supplemental material for writers to use.
Support,"at the time when christianity was first formally establishing its own doctrine, it was seen as one of the most egalitarian religions because it elevated the status of women to be equal in the eyes of god.","according to historian geoffrey blainey, many of those who held positions of authority within palestine were disapproving of how well jesus treated the women during his life geoffrey blainey; a short history of christianity ."

Support,democracies can continue to evolve new creative mechanisms to deal with the procedural problems they face as they grow in size.,proposals have been made to explain how even variants of direct democracy could be implemented in very large societies.
Support,interpol is not the equivalent of a global police force it is merely meant to facilitate international collaboration between different police forces so that these can perform their duties more effectively.,interpol cannot conduct investigations or make arrests . the organization just helps the local police know where to look for the suspects.
Support,this confuses universality with objectivity. to say that the holocaust was objectively bad is not to say that everyone can agree that it is bad. objectivity is precisely about something being good or bad independent of opinion.,to say that the holocaust was objectively bad is to say that it would have been bad even if the nazis would have won the second world war and killed or brainwashed anyone who disagreed so that everyone believed that the holocaust was a good thing. it's irrelevant who agrees or disagrees.
Attack,"since capitalism was envisioned as a system to maximize personal freedom, the existence of capitalist dictatorships demonstrates a disconnect between economic systems and the freedoms they promise.","capitalism was envisioned as a system to maximize the pursuit of enlightened self interest , not freedom."
Support,interstellar transport is feasible and alien life not unlikely. with 2020s spaceflight tech 0.06 speed of light sol the entire galaxy would be traversable in 0.15 bn years. it is likely that 0 much older civilizations have faster means of spaceflight and are closer. replicating probes could quickly reach many galactic regions if intended if nothing stops or prevents them. colonization may spread through our galaxy with 5 sol in 1.4 m years 20 seem feasible . some are likely motivated.,see discussion 1258: alien life has existed or does exist.
Support,keeping these monuments divides the country by alienating minorities.,"while the argument against alienating minorities may be too broad, these monuments also alienate whites by perpetuating the nostalgia that white americans are deserving of all opportunities, whereas other groups are not. this underlying belief needs to be challenged: the removing of such monuments would do so."
Support,"the mind is not the soul, despite what the parent claim implies.","the mind is an emergent property of the brain, evidenced by changes in the mind relating to physical or chemical changes in the brain like tumours or damage or hormonal imbalances and by the apparent disappearance of the mind at the cessation of brain activity."
Attack,the political will to finance an eu standing army does not exist.,"creating a common eu army might reduce the overall cost of defending europe, because countries would stop duplicating one another's military capacities."
Support,"jesus and his followers thought they were living in the end of days, and yet they were deeply mistaken about this.",the author of the epistle to the hebrews claims to be living in these last days .
Attack,"food production is likely to decrease significantly because of climate change. this reduction in supply, alongside an increase in demand, will increase the price of food significantly, making it inaccessible for many p. 494 .",governments often unite to come to the aid of countries being devastated by famine.
Support,"dominance is often confused with superiority, and these two are not interchangeable in terms of culture.","western countries have caused millions of deaths through slavery, colonialism, and two global conflicts. thus, western culture has been dominant, but not superior."
Support,safe spaces limit the free speech of others while doing nothing to enhance the free speech of minorities.,safe spaces make it difficult to discuss important yet uncomfortable issues in public settings.
Support,"testing products on animals does not necessarily make the product safe for humans. as different species respond differently when exposed to the same chemicals, results from animal tests may not be relevant to humans.","just as we don't use human test subjects for animal medicine, we shouldn't use animal subjects for human medicine."
Attack,"cloning animals would not solve the cause of planetary damage, human greed.",many animals became extinct because humans did not foresee the consequences of their actions. this is less likely to happen when the risks are known.
Attack,"the moon would not require the exorbitant technological developments i.e. r d to get there, due to the convenience.","not investing heavily into developing technology is a hamper to societal progress, as will just lead to less advanced equipment."
Attack,"progressive thinkers should not strive to silence dissenting voices by banning them with the help of state laws. a more ethical and less alienating way forward is to communicate with religious communities about the dangers of discrimination, so that they can endorse inclusive views and institute change from within.",discriminatory beliefs are already inherently a part of most major world religions eg. views on roles of women and homosexuality . it's unlikely that these large bodies will alter their entire belief system.
Support,man made objects are better for living on than mars.,"mars is located at most 250 million miles from earth, which is too far to traverse in emergencies. man made objects could be built much closer to mitigate this."
Attack,the church generally does not allow divorce or remarriage .,"the pope has made it easier for couples to get an annulment , which indicates a growing recognition of the need for some couples to part ways."
Support,a sample of homeschooling families found that they score higher on measures of family cohesion than the general population.,"one study found that homeschooling reduced stress levels in families, mainly due to a reduction in the number of external demands on them pp. 200 201 ."
Attack,the nuclear warfare strategies are aimed at the complete destruction of the enemy.,at the military destruction primarily and not the civilian casualties.
Support,"if learning a foreign language is less helpful to a student's future than learning science, then any allocation of resources would be wasteful.","given their importance to society, stem degrees are highly sought after and could one day be offered for free . no such proposal is made for language degrees."
Support,pronouns allow people the freedom to select the identity with which they wish to be associated.,gender identities often come with prescriptive behavioural norms which can impact self expression and identity. more freedom to choose one's gender allows them greater freedom in their own actions.
Support,there is no medical need for circumcising an infant.,"some branches of orthodox christianity, specifically coptic , ethiopian and eritrean , practise circumcision as a right of passage."
Support,"two miracles cannot be more plausible than one miracle. that is, adding more miracles cannot make other miracle claims more plausible.","any number of miracle claims is equally improbable: 0 , literally impossible apart from divine intervention. if god acted once for a person, he might do so again, any number of other times, with no reason to do so less rather than more. once any miracle is involved, probabilities, and thus any sense of evidence posterior probability , goes out the window."
Support,"the prime minister has to inform the monarch of the affairs concerning the realm nergelius, p.41 .","a failure to do so, such when prime minister göran persson did not inform the monarch of swedish victims in the 2004 indian tsunami , draws criticism ."
Support,climate change has not been adequately substantiated by science. some doubt the scientific consensus.,"there is competing evidence about the scale and severity of warming caused by human co₂ emissions, which may undercut projections made by the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc ."
Support,mdma has been shown to have uses in dealing with certain ailments.,"mdma, the main ingredient in ecstasy, may be used in the treatment of various psychological problems."
Attack,"there are no morally relevant differences between one day and the next at any point between a fertilised ovum and an adult; this is effectively a sorites paradox . birth offers a bright line distinction between abortion and infanticide , which should be used even if we are not sure that babies have personhood.","by that logic, the same thing can be said about conception, that you are saying about birth."
Support,working over 39 hours a week was shown to have negative effects on mental health .,"working 5 hours a day instead of 8 hours or more has shown to increase productivity, performance, and increased happiness."
Support,"monotheistic scriptures do not consistently support omnipotence, omniscience and omnibenevolence.",the scene of jesus crying out on the cross that god has forsaken him suggests a god who is neither omnipresent nor omnibenevolent.
Attack,there might be other undiscovered or unexplored planets that would be even better hosts for the human race.,"it would be impractical to move the human race to an extrasolar planet, even if one were to be discovered."
Attack,"this just shows how it would boost negative behavior where society is doing nothing but generating clickbait, controversy, provocations, making use of 'sex sells', and polarization among other things.","for people who already effectively learn about the relevant areas unofficially, learning it officially will not help them much."
Support,"if women have to make the first step, it doesn't make dating harder for them. in fact, it makes the process more enjoyable for women since they have greater control over deciding whom they wish to have a conversation with.","on apps that facilitate women messaging first to maintain the match, women can be certain that random matches won't be able to harass them if they don't want to start a conversation."
Support,a white house report concluded that the bulk collection of americans' phone records was not essential to thwarting terror attacks.,"not only was it not essential, it has been reported that none of the data used in preventing terrorism has, to date, come from sources that would be off limits to intelligence agencies under restricted data collection, i.e. the terrorists have always been subject of ongoing, warrant based suspicion and monitoring, rather than mass surveillance of the general public without cause."
Support,"both science and humanities subjects are conceptually distinct enough to be taught separately. thus, it is legitimate to focus on one over another.",english literature is the study of english texts while biology is the study of living organisms .
Attack,government provision of health care is likely to create a very inefficient system.,a healthcare system that does not discriminate clients based on their ability to pay is more efficient in improving a country's overall health outcomes.
Attack,having a singular culture would likely eliminate harmful cultural practices like female genital mutilation or honor killings .,these practices can be eliminated without destroying all cultural diversity.
Attack,"their reasoning goes something like this: it's impossible for the gospels to be historically accurate, because they record things that simply can't happen, like dead people coming alive again and food multiplying miracles, in other words. we live in a closed universe of natural order, with god if there is a god locked out of the system. if miracles can't happen, then the reports in the new testament must be fabrications. therefore, the gospels are not historical.",see 1.1.1.2.2.1.2.4.1.10.5.1.3.1.1.2.1.1.4.2.1.3.3.1.2.
Attack,"women are judged by their looks more, which undermines their confidence.","in the context of speed dating , men and women judge their partner on their looks just as much as each other."
Support,approval voting has a history of successful usage.,the catholic church successfully used approval voting for over 300 years to elect 41 popes.
Attack,psychoanalyst carl jung argued that masculine and feminine archetypes are foundational components of the psyche.,"many psychiatrists interpret jung's analysis to mean that masculine and feminine qualities exist in all people, thereby freeing their clients from strict gender roles."
Support,"it's unclear how this is a negative element of the movie. just labelling a subplot as having 'far left' sentiments does not negate the argument that the film presents for its political undertones. people enjoying extravagant leisure activities that are paid for by war mongering are surely gaining from the exploitation of those beneath them, which is understandably outrageous to finn and rose.",if star wars has a political thread running through it then it has always been to the left. the overthrow of the state because of the state's misuse of power are what iv vi are about and the empire is painted as so oppressive as to make its over throw obvious. the last jedi's canto bight scenes continue that theme with a message about personal misuse of power which shows an increasing narrative sophistication. star wars universe is getting more nuanced but it has always been to the left.
Attack,"tech companies are likely to bid higher for ai services, raising the costs for schools.",the investments made by tech companies in ai could make ai more efficient and accessible for academic use.
Support,"our economic system is designed for achievers to become wealthy, but capitalism needs facilitation and protection. a society that accepts its trade offs and drawbacks, and yet supports such a system, is assisting those who succeed within it.","without strong property rights that are prominent within our society, capitalism could not work."
Attack,a culturally homogenous society is more likely to be stable as people are more likely to agree with one another.,"if a culture is homogeneous, implying the same or similar values, etc. among individuals, the society adhering to that culture is would be prone to a lack of innovation and artistic merits."
Support,"for example, cooking, health literacy, web search skills, media literacy, practical code development, and practical engineering base skills are not or rarely taught.",people search the web daily and most can't do it well and never learned anything that helps with it.
Attack,an attempt to ban religion could lead to the radicalization of religious individuals who feel compelled to defend their faith against the state.,"banning religion would limit the reach of extremist groups, reducing their followers and supporters, who are vulnerable to radicalization."
Support,"diversity itself is touted as bringing different approaches to work. however, the nature of cultures is that they have inertia, so there is no expectation that the most efficient approach would be adopted by all, or even any.","where change is possible, the most vocal, most senior, most obsequious, and least discriminated against all have an edge, regardless of the efficiency of their chosen approach."
Support,"enough hardware to run a dangerous agi might already exist, just not the software. because human level agi could write software, it might be able to rapidly develop an agi that uses existing hardware more optimally, which would then be a super human level agi.","chess engines superior to deep blue have been developed , which could beat it even when run on inferior hardware. thus, while hardware capacity is necessary, algorithms are more important."
Attack,"the gospel accounts, just like other historical documents, bear no special burden of proof. there are good reasons to think the gospels are reliable until proven wrong.","the biblical narrative is not corroborated by other sources. other sources mention jesus and it is generally considered that jesus did in fact exist, however, none of his supposed miracles or divinity are supported by other sources."
Support,much of the political resistance towards veganism comes from misrepresentation of vegans through pro meat lobbies or the media.,"the livestock industry lobbies many powerful governments around the world, as well as international institutions like the un ."
Attack,"the us used its veto powers to block a un security council call for an immediate ceasefire, which would have impeded the idf's plan to root out hamas.",the use of a veto to prevent a humanitarian call for an immediate ceasefire is an example of how the us abuses its powers and perpetuates conflict in the gaza strip.
Attack,transgender women have an advantage over biological women because they have the bodies of biological men.,one study found that transgender females do not have an athletic advantage over cisgender females.
Support,pregnancy can be an important motivator for recovery from substance abuse. a license would likely remove this motivation as it would inhibit substance users from being able to keep their child.,"individuals who were previously denied a license due to substance abuse would be unlikely to keep their child in the event of an accidental pregnancy, even if they had recovered."
Support,"video games create opportunities for players to exploit, stalk, and abuse each other.",video games that are popular among younger players can put them at risk by making it easier to find and approach them online.
Attack,it is natural to prefer the survival of those you identify with. human life should be valued above other life as one's family is valued above others' families.,"if it is true that a human naturally prefers one s family over other humans and that a human considers a pet as part of their family, then it would not be natural for the human to value non family humans more than family pets."
Attack,homeschooling parents have many options to ensure their children are active and play sports.,"when physical education classes are not mandatory, it is likely that more students will slip through the cracks, not engaging in any regular exercise."
Attack,elon musk identifies agi as a grave existential risk.,elon musk is actively promoting ai through creating openai gym.
Attack,"a corporation with outstanding debt can declare bankruptcy, dissolve and reform as a different company, whereas humans cannot change their identity to avoid their debts.","the unavailability of the personal bankruptcy procedure is a flaw of legislation, rather than economy system."

Attack,"the us is a constitutional democracy or, more accurately, constitutional federal republic . the constitution upon which the state is founded gives the president the power to pardon.","the constitution was written in 1787 , so some of its contents may be outdated or irrelevant. the constitution should be amended to reflect the changing needs and ethos of contemporary america."
Attack,this is an argument to reform the nhs rather than replace it with something else.,"in the last 30 years , there have been 15 major structural changes to nhs organisations and there is 'little evidence' that they produced 'much, if any, improvement'. due to this, many people, including gps and think tanks , are against any nhs reforms."

Support,"placing limitations on presidential pardons would compromise the broad scope of the power, which is currently limited by only a few exceptions .",removing the president's ability to pardon war crimes would require an amendment to the us constitution.
Attack,"this is not a cost efficient or practical likely result. it is easier, cheaper, and safer for a court to not seek an absolute monopoly over a sizeable territory.","this is a misunderstanding of the parent claim and of how legal and trade systems practically work . two overlapping jurisdictions that can enforce rulings through the threat of punishment would have to settle a competing claim through either: a dispute mechanism whereby they both submit to a higher authority de facto establishing a hierarchy , withdrawing to agreed territories with borders requiring enforcement , or both trying to enforce their judgements armed conflict ."
Attack,"the search for evidence to support a theory is prone to confirmation bias. if an entire field is biased toward naturalism to an extent that it blinds itself, it will filter evidence, data, and studies selectively, with a more philosophical approach than a scientific one. biased studies citing biased studies create compound error, and any objection invites dismissal.",this point is confusing because it seems to advocate evolution should be studied with a more philosophical approach and yet the original thesis aims to distinguish evolution as science in opposition to philosophy.
Attack,having no satisfactory explanation yet is very different from being an inconceivable problem.,"if the materialistic world view can't explain consiousness, or as some professors have stated, consciousness should not exist based on a materialistic world view, then it suggests that it is metaphysical in nature."
Attack,"there is already a lot of mistrust toward some sectors of the economy, including media and technology.","the media and technology industries rely heavily on constantly evolving trends, which ex offenders miss out on while they are incarcerated. therefore, ex offenders will not be a good fit for these fields."
Support,"according to fbi figures , there were 16,470 murders in the us in 2016, and well over a million violent crimes generally. by comparison, the us executed only 20 people in 2016, so even a murderer faces a miniscule chance of execution.","it is unlikely that someone committing a crime would conceive of the possibility of receiving the death penalty, since it is such a small probability."
Support,"a head of state with the absolute power to pardon themself for crimes, including those of which they are convicted , is one of the hallmarks of a dictatorship, so self pardons should be banned.","president nixon , who once considered a self pardon , famously stated, when the president does it, that means it is not illegal, implying that presidents are above the law. however, in a democracy, no one is above the law ."
Attack,people of differing religions backgrounds claim to interact with their own god or gods and nearly all claiming only theirs is the only real a true one. thus throwing all such interactions into question.,throwing an interaction into question is not the same as dismissing an interaction. it could be possible for a group of complementing interactions to be true and all the contradicting interactions to be faulty.
Support,"little more is needed for security than cameras, weapons, public support, and public oversight of the processing and handling of criminals,.",public oversight of the processing and handling of criminals can be achieved with almost nothing more than a single body camera if its video is publicly released.
Attack,according to some religious beliefs we are equal in spirit as we all go to the same place when we die,"some religions insist non believers will go to hell and that men are superior to women , regardless of any other consideration of an individuals character. therefore broad reference to religion as indication of equality is not a strong premise for equality. 5 things to know about the traditional christian doctrine of hell study when religion hurts: structural sexism and health in religious congregations."
Support,"just because a neural network exchanges information that does not qualify it as consciousness. plant and tree organisms exchange information about moisture in the soil and how much sun they are getting, but we would not consider them to be conscious.",the material brains and material machines are fundamentally different from conscious minds.
Support,"the concept of democracy is in definite contrast to monarchy . conceptually, while the first is a type of government that puts power in the hand of the nation s people, the second bestows power in the hand of an individual.","monarchs are symbols of oppression as they acquired their status by violent and immoral means, and maintained it through violence and indefensible concentration of wealth and power."
Support,not having a child is sufficient contribution to the fight against climate change.,"the modern child is likely to live longer , meaning they could have more time to increase their carbon footprint."
Attack,"corporal punishment can certainly motivate students to remain engaged, but most countries believe that this is not a desirable form of motivation and therefore decline to use it.","while both corporal punishment and the necessity of life skills are both external motivators, the latter is unavoidable and not inherently harmful, rendering this a false equivalency."
Support,killing someone through inaction is just as bad as killing them through action. the fact that you didn't directly kill them so you don't have to feel as guilty doesn't mean that you're being moral ... it means you're being selfish by caring about your own feelings of guilt more than doing the right thing.,the real question is what action or inaction causes the most suffering ... and not whether you directly killed someone.
Support,animal testing has been effective in helping save endangered species.,"without animal testing, scientists would be unable to design methods that help endangered species reproduce in captivity and the wild."
Support,planned parenthood has been accused of supporting racism and eugenics.,"margaret sanger, the founder of planned parenthood, has been portrayed as a proponent of eugenics and supporter of the ku klux klan ."
Attack,"rights and moral duties exist independently of human civilization and society. if someone were alone on a desert island with a stranger, it would still be wrong to kill that stranger. so rights exist independently of, and therefore do not arise from, the social contract.","two strangers on a desert island are no longer under the influence of societal ideals and norms. unless they expect to reenter society at a later point, where they would be held accountable for their actions, they may deem it morally acceptable to kill each other over a fish, in order to survive."
Support,a number of passages in the qur'an suggest that men have a place of primacy in marriage and that women are required to obey their husbands ; this view is held by the majority of muslims across the globe .,the qur'an appears to sanction the sexual abuse of wives within marriage.
Support,the current form of capitalism is causing a widening of the income inequality gap.,"according to the office for national statistics , the top 10 of households by income earn 6.8 times more than those on the lowest rung, but the wealthiest 10 have 290 times more in total assets than those at the bottom of the pile."
Attack,neither did the colonies need economic improvement nor did colonization result in economic improvement.,the reported adverse effects of colonization on the economy of british india do not account for population growth . this is why growth in gdp did not necessarily translate into gdp per capita.
Attack,proper study design can eliminate many possible sources of observational bias p. 664 .,objective study designs are not inherently more likely to generate scientific truth .
Attack,"feminism is not about the representation of feminine virtues and many feminists would, on the contrary, regard the argument that the film fails because the women are not feminine enough as deeply sexist.",real feminism is not the belief that women can be just as masculine as men. real feminism is the belief that femininity is just as valuable as masculinity.
Attack,"the fact that we managed to domesticate wild animals like horses and dogs, proves the potential to teach animals to live side by side with humans.",the number of species that humans have been able to totally or even partially domesticate is small compared to the total number of animal species on earth.
Support,"there is one case where a farmer saw an ufo abduct and kill a cow which he drew and photographed . in another case, a farmer couple witnessed aliens from an ufo abducting and levitating a cow. there likely are further cases.",judy doraty reportedly saw a cattle mutilation by aliens.
Attack,"star voting narrowly lost in lane county, yet there are several factors that worked against it that make it likely that it would've approximated or beaten approval's performance in fargo, meaning that it serves as narrow evidence that scored methods may outperform or equal approval voting on ballot measure victories.","star voting, because of its inherent complexity, may be less likely to win big than approval voting, because it is a smarter strategy to focus on a majority of the easiest voters than to try to persuade the confused misunderstanding anti reform partisan minority."
Attack,humans make the most valuable contributions to the world and therefore should be valued above animals.,humans can only define something as valuable from their own perspective and cannot determine if their actions are equally valuable for all living beings.
Attack,different cultures are causing communication problems.,"many of these problems are due to language issues. these can be resolved over time, for example through investments in language education."
Support,arguments about sheer improbability usually make use of a very naive notion of coming about by chance .,"naive assessments of probability assume there is one opportunity that either has to make all changes or not. instead, self organizing systems work by using trillions of trials and succeed one change at a time. the naive calculation of probability does not take this into account."
Attack,planned parenthood claims that accusations of unethical behavior on their part are ideologically driven and unsupported by fact p. 1 .,planned parenthood's denial does not prove that they are not behaving unethically.
Attack,"historically, systems which involve extreme government intervention and control over finances have proven to be unsuccessful and inefficient.","the existence of a maximum wage, which merely regulates compensation, is qualitatively different from fully centralized and state owned economies."

Attack,voter turnout is low and declining among many democratic countries. compulsory voting would prevent this.,"many countries that have mandatory voting do not enforce it, meaning that they end up with voter turnout rates that are closer to the averages in similar countries."
Attack,it is not the responsibility of private employers to engage in social charity work.,private organisations already have corporate social responsibility programs and should be allowed to pursue their own interests among many social issues.

Attack,the correspondence of the sex and gender binaries is a central feature of human society.,gender discrimination by society is widespread and often attributed to sex differences. suggesting that gender is informed by biology legitimizes these injustices.
Support,"retrocausality , or the idea that physical laws function the same if time flows from past to future or from future to past, is possible in some interpretations of quantum physics .",retrocausation provides a viable alternative to the problematic superdeterminism versus action at a distance debate by preserving local causation p. 1 .
Support,consumers can choose to purchase meat that is farmed in an environmentally friendly manner.,"raising animals for meat using responsible pasturing practices utilizes land that cannot be farmed, improves the soil and pasture to more closely mimic native prairie, supports the livelihood of the farmers and keeps the land in question free of harmful urban development."
Support,"if gender differs based on culture, then it, too, is quintessentially subjective , i.e., representative of the perceptions of the subject in this case, a particular culture rather than of independent reality, unless the two should happen to coincide.","we can guarantee the coincidence of cultural perception with reality by adopting rigorous methodologies of inquiry not subject to whim but geared toward the pursuit of objectivity by means of independent observation of reality e.g., the sciences ."
Support,governments banning homeschooling could find ways to make the transition easier.,"a ban can be implemented such that no new homeschooling is permitted, but children currently being homeschooled can continue until they finish their education."
Attack,"even if the earth were to be hit by massive calamities, some humans would be able to go underground, build special shelters, or find some other way to continue the species in low numbers.","the genetic diversity of humans may decrease which can lead to an extinction vortex , where inbreeding causes lower individual evolutionary fitness and a decreasing population."
Attack,arguments require definitions for the sake of consistency.,"right, but lack of or inaccurate definitions are methodological failures. this does not necessitate that the thesis is false."
Support,"some criminals embrace death or view it as inevitable, and so would not be deterred by the death penalty.","many terrorists expect, and plan, to die committing their crime. the prospect of possibly being sentenced to die years later is hardly going to deter them p. 88 ."

Support,"humans restrict the freedom and autonomy of countless of living organisms for their entire lives and the lives of generations to come, including other humans.","domesticated animals have no natural freedoms , they are almost entirely stripped away for the purpose of production for humans."
Attack,high income countries could instead increase financial donations to the united nations refugee agency unhcr .,"the unhcr lists the resettlement of refugees as one of its core competencies, so donating to the unhcr is not an alternative to the resettlement of refugees in foreign countries."

Attack,"al qaeda, imperial japan, nazi germany, and the confederacy fought for the destruction of the united states.","it can be argued that while the first three actively fought for the destruction of the us, the confederacy was simply fighting to separate from it. as such, these are not analogous forces."

Attack,"specifically, it facilitates the reduction of suffering among living beings capable of suffering. reducing suffering is good.","if reducing suffering is good, but we do not have to end suffering entirely, then responsible farming of domesticated livestock accomplishes this end, as few domesticated animals living in these circumstances will suffer as much, or die as miserably as their wild counterparts."

Attack,the total amount of energy in a closed system cannot be created nor destroyed according to the first law of thermodynamics.,"the laws of physics are predicated by the existence of the universe, having come into being as a consequence of the creation event. therefore, it is an assumption that the laws of physics were also applicable at the creation event, since these laws were yet to be determined."

Support,those with disabilities already face a number of obstacles limiting their access to voting. mandating voting increases the chance of unjust punishments and further disenfranchisement for these individuals.,it may be difficult for those with mobility disabilities to access voting stations and booths.
Attack,adults are not necessarily more emotionally mature than minors in making decisions.,"while not every adult may be more emotionally mature than every child, average age differences in emotion regulation are statistically significant enough to warrant consideration."
Attack,"one cannot determine which, if any, of the various suggested moral frameworks are correct without using pre given objective morals. therefore, moral frameworks cannot provide a solution.",there is no reason given to think you need pre given objective morals to determine which is correct. it seems we can just do it by reason. this is too quick of a dismissal.
Support,there are not enough private healthcare providers in america to be able to cope with demand should planned parenthood have to close clinics .,"in 68 of counties with a family planning centre, planned parenthood serves at least half of all patients seeking family planning services, and planned parenthood is the only family planning service provider in 21 of all counties."
Support,science is not political because it has no agenda for political change.,"political acts involve deciding how how to excise power others. while science can provide facts about the world that can inform these decisions, it cannot provide the value judgements that determine how those decisions are made."
Attack,"these platforms, as expressions of our modern society, seem to be applying the paradox of tolerance formulated by the philosopher karl popper. according to his theory, defending tolerance requires to not tolerate the intolerant.","often was is seen as 'unreasonable' or 'intolerant' is defined by the dominant social views of the politically powerful. for a long time, those advocating socialized healthcare were seen as 'ridiculous' ."
Attack,"chatbots can help marginalized students perform better , potentially reducing inequalities in academic achievement.",but chatbots can also reinforce already dominant forms of expression and writing and thereby further marginalize other valid forms of expression and writing .
Support,there is public support for making treatment more expensive or harder to access for people with unhealthy lifestyles.,"many surgeons in australia have argued that they should have the right to refuse the provision of heart and lung surgeries to smokers, even those who need the operations to stay alive, as these patients contribute to their own demise."
Support,"when the declaration of financial information is obligatory, it becomes harder to access profits from illegal goods or services since it is evident when spending habits don't match individuals' declared income. this makes it difficult for criminals to operate.",tax havens jurisdictions where it is easy to hide money are an essential part of how criminal organizations maintain banking secrecy and shield themselves from judicial activity. wealth and income registries would eliminate the ability to use tax havens to maintain banking secrecy.
Attack,president macron has made remarks and proposed policies that can be perceived as islamophobic.,president macron has been sympathetic to the concerns of the muslim community.
Attack,"the properties that go to make up maximal excellence have intrinsic maximum values, whereas the excellent making properties of things like island do not.","special pleading. if it doens't work for awesomeness , neither does it work for excellence . things are more awesome if they exist. what's the difference?"
Attack,scriptures are often taken out of context in their application in modern times.,"some acts of violence in scriptures, such as genocide , are not excusable regardless of when they took place."
Support,countries in the middle east have done more than their fair share when it comes to hosting refugees.,more than 5 million displaced syrians have been hosted by neighbouring countries in the middle east and north africa. on the other hand only 1 million displaced syrians now live in europe.
Support,"the point paul is making by putting on the new spiritual body, given that the physical body is subject to corruption and decay, is that the naked soul will put on this new non physical body and the physical body will be destroyed, leaving only the new spiritual body. like putting on a coat and taking off the shirt underneath it.","in 1 cor 15 :36 38, we read: 36 what you sow does not come to life unless it dies. 37 when you sow, you do not plant the body that will be, but just a seed, perhaps of wheat or of something else. 38 but god gives it a body as he has determined, and to each kind of seed he gives its own body. thus, the resurrection body is not the body that is sown which is like a seed compared to the resurrection body."
Attack,most extinct species in no way contributed to the evolution of humans.,"this seems implausible because being a food source for an ancestor of humans, or being a food source for a species that in turn served as a food source for an ancestor of humans, etc. is enough to affect human evolution."
Support,capitalist democracies reliably lead to the best outcomes in countless metrics of societal flourishing.,the countries that top the rankings of gender equality are capitalist.
Attack,"innovation in and of itself is not crucial to education, as not all changes are positive.",innovation and evolution in all other industries will make it harder for the domain of education to stay relevant if the domain doesn't innovate and evolve.
Support,every minority group should learn a martial art no matter sexual orientation.,making special exceptions for the lgbt community will further stigmatize them.
Support,students can start off in the workforce without issues of overwhelming debt.,poor mental health as a result of debt affects people's performance at work.
Support,religious claims should not be seen as legitimate as israel does not enforce jewish law.,"religious claims played very little role in the early zionist movement and the creation of israel. rather, zionists argued there was need for a jewish majority nation state to enforce the rights of jewish people."
Support,history makes it abundantly clear that citizens make social change possible by spurring the government to take action.,informed citizens are able to improve policy making ; politicians enact policies that reflect public pressure and actually improve lives and society at large.
Support,religion offers many insights into the makeup of the human race and our earliest conceptions of consciousness.,religions are essentially theories of everything that offer members a holistic understanding of the world.
Support,making your preferred frontrunner your first choice instead of your favorite candidate will reliably improve your chances of getting a good outcome.,"voters have already learned to do this under fptp, so it isn't too difficult for voters to follow this strategy."
Attack,"same is true for alcohol, still most people are not alcoholics and alcohol is not banned in most countries.","the discussion is about morality, not legality. a world in which no one drank alcohol would arguably be better, but it's not banned because practically trying to enforce such a ban has historically failed and lead to more problems."
Support,mainstream media cannot be held responsible for the content of fringe outlets or online discussion boards.,"some mainstream news outlets, like national pubic radio in the united states, intentionally promote media literacy in order to moderate political discourse."
Attack,"we cannot expect violent and non repentant criminals to be rehabilitated. if a violent criminal can t be rehabilitated and must be separated from society for the safety of the community, better to execute them and be done with them so they can never be a threat again. indeed, they should not be living among us.",the concept of an ultimate consequence only holds virtuous if there is no possibility of a mistake. it is better to let a guilty person go free than to kill an innocent.
Attack,"research from the anti defamation league adl indicates that 53 of the harassment in online gaming communities is related to race, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, or ethnicity.","since the mid 2000s, there has been an ongoing reckoning with sexism and racism in the video game community. over time, these issues will likely improve."
Support,"when voters use the full range for their scores, score is biased unfairly in favor of candidates who are surrounded by other candidates in opinion space, even if this is far from the center of voter preferences. see comment on animated voting methods .","while voters may not use the full range in general, polarising extremist candidates would likely elicit not just the full range usage, but also min max exaggeration. can be seen in this survey in which the bnp received min scores far in excess of any other party even after accounting for the left leaning nature of the respondents."
Attack,pope francis still opposes the ordination of women .,pope francis does not use rhetoric of subservience to justify his position against ordination.
Attack,"as the designer of all things, a monotheistic god is capable of imbuing life with ultimate meaning or purpose. without god to create humans and meaning, life is absurd .","humans give meaning to their own existence, not god. many atheists find a purpose in life without god."
Attack,children haven't been able to experience as much of life as an adult. it would thus be more unfair to take away this experience from them.,"as children have experienced life less, in the absence of life, they would miss it less."
Support,the increasing over representation of black players in american football has been tied to concerns about racial and class divisions in the united states.,"while families in affluent communities increasingly steer their children to activities with less risk of head trauma, many families from more disadvantaged backgrounds encourage their children to play football because of the perceived economic benefits ."
Attack,polygamous families have more time and resources to make sure that children always have someone looking after them; they can take turns babysitting and educating while others have their date nights and adventures.,"given that large family units require greater income to accomodate for their needs, polygamous families are unlikely to have more disposable income to supplement childcare."
Attack,if education is compulsory and not free then there can be a huge discrepancy between the quality of education people from different financial backgrounds will receive.,"scholarships, grants, and financial aid can help bridge the gap for lower income students, allowing them access to higher quality education options."
Support,corporal punishment constitutes assault and an infringement on the bodily autonomy of children.,"children are typically unable to give informed consent to corporal punishment, making any physical discipline an imposition on their autonomy."
Attack,"in traditional and restrictive societies, expressions of lgbtq identities are punishable by law. by extension, teaching such subjects in school would be prohibited.","while the idea that it should be taught everywhere is intrinsically idealistic and thus impossible as of now, gender identity and sexual orientation should still be taught in areas where these things are not punishable by law."
Support,the death sentence provides an effective deterrent in terms of stopping other people from committing the same crime.,most people fear death; the death penalty therefore imposes a far higher cost than typical imprisonment.
Support,church father quotations of the bible written before the 4th century can be compared to 4th century and later translations to prove that they weren't corrupted over time.,"ignatius's d. 107 quotation of ephesians 5:2 in his epistle to the ephesians 1 matches our modern version , proving the text has not been corrupted since his time."
Support,religious exemption laws could be used to enable discrimination against children.,religious exemption laws should be repealed in order to prevent children suffering from illnesses that could have been prevented .
Support,"the use of ai will facilitate cheating in schools, which reduces the quality of education students receive.","promoting the use of ai in schools would normalise the use of ai in academic work, making students more likely to use it to cheat in tests."
Attack,"many successful people lack certain life skills, but can employ others to execute these for them.",the cost of employing other people to perform basic life skills comes hand in hand with a level of success many are unlikely to reach.
Support,"governments also cause pollution. merely noting that using materials, especially extracting energy, has consequences does not distinguish corporations from the alternative.",possibly the largest single environmental destruction ever was done by a government: chernobyl .
Support,studies have found no link between video games and aggressive thought formation.,a new study published by oxford university demonstrated that there is no link between violent video games and aggression in teenagers.
Support,healthcare is a basic necessity. this creates an obligation for government to provide healthcare.,healthcare should be part of a more generic social safety net provided by government.
Attack,"while assuming that something is the case does not make it true, assumptions can have explanatory value if they impact our understanding of other observable phenomena.","while assuming that free will exists makes it easier to talk about moral responsibility and creativity, it does not mean that free will has been observed or supported by empirical evidence."
Attack,ionic bonds are also important to the formation of tertiary protein structures.,"while both bonds are involved, covalent bonds provide the strongest forces involved in these structures."
Attack,syria does not rank very high on the list of the european union's trade partners.,"regardless of where syria stands among other trading partners, trade between the eu and syria amounts to hundreds of millions of euros annually , which is not a small amount."
Attack,"president nixon considered a self pardon , which he later abandoned due to contrary legal advice. this demonstrates that the legality of self pardons is contentious.","many believe that, rather than risking the uncertain outcome of a self pardon, nixon made a quid pro quo deal with his chosen successor, ford: the presidency in exchange for a pardon."
Support,"trump had no regard for diplomacy, thus limiting his foreign policy achievements.","trump has alienated and insulted many traditional allies, such as germany, britain, and south korea. confidence in american leadership has measurably declined as a result of his leadership."
Attack,"killing an animal can only be justified by extreme necessities, such as survival; consuming a living creature just for its taste, for convenience, or out of habit is thus not justifiable.","humans are at the top of the food chain, which means that they are merely following the natural order of things when they kill and eat other animals."
Support,organized religions discourage personal exploration and spirituality.,religion has made widespread the idea that spirituality is connected to institutions or communities when in fact it is an individual experience. this has diminished the value of spirituality on individual levels.
Support,the government should not interfere in the personal affairs of consenting adults.,the freedom of individuals should only be limited when it infringes on the freedom of others; polygamy does not meet this criteria.
Support,"animals can survive without humans, whereas humans require animals to survive.",domination through control of resources only highlights our dependence upon those resources. mismanagement through de valuing resources such as animals is a danger.
Support,"most confederate monuments are not particularly old and have likely been put up with the intent to demonstrate dominance over african americans during two different time periods: the jim crow era 1900 1918 and the civil rights movement era 1954 1968 splc, p. 12 .","it is crucial to understand the timing of the appearance of these monuments their historical context, especially in the south where reconstruction gave rise to jim crow laws, lynchings, and birth of a nation ."
Attack,"during his presidency, donald trump issued several pardons that have been regarded as unethical . on his last day in office alone, he pardoned several political allies, friends, and cronies .",trump used his presidential power to grant pardons less frequently than most other presidents in history. this underscores his ability to exercise restraint in the use of executive power.
Attack,jehovah's witnesses' structure and operations suggest that they are the one true church.,the jehovah's witness organization has a sex abuse problem.
Attack,the declaration of independence states that it is the duty of citizens to throw off any government which abuses its power or becomes overly oppressive.,"in federalist 46 , madison used the notion of the state militia to argue that the government should be designed in such a way that it would never be necessary to overthrow in the first place."
Attack,"the power to put up statues is also the power to control history. there was no such control on what statues came up, hence we can't use this argument for what statues should come down.","rather than silencing or removing monuments, additional monuments may be erected by local residents to offer a contrasting or competing view, if desired."
Support,humans have morally acceptable reasons to kill animals besides eating them. if a human has a good reason to kill an animal it would be immoral to waste the edible sections of that animal.,"hunting is beneficial to the environment as it helps prevent over population of several species of animal that, if un controlled, would destroy the environments they live in."
Attack,"capitalism isn't perfect, but capitalists create businesses and jobs, so giving them investment capital makes sense.","capitalists don't create jobs, they create products or services to generate wealth. the jobs are a 'currently necessary' by product of the business."
Attack,meat effectively delivers important nutrients for humans.,"neal barnard of the physicians committee for responsible medicine notes that when people switch from meat eating to plant eating, their intake of vitamins and other nutrients improves."
Attack,there are various objective levels of sufficiency and several if not all of those are not met such as the paris agreement 1.5 c where it can be objectively assessed whether humanity is on course or not and it is not.,whether it can be objectively determined whether a given standard is met is not the same as whether setting the standard at that level is objectively correct.
Attack,"only 1 2 resulted in nonparalytic meningitis, and fewer than 1 resulted in paralysis. among paralytic cases, many recovered completely and most recovered muscle function to some degree.","the less than 1 rate of paralysis with polio infection, is far greater than the risk of paralysis or death from the vaccine"
Attack,a global shift to veganism is economically unviable.,"as demand for vegan products and industries grow, jobs with varying skill levels will be created . these will increase employment and bolster economies around the world."
Support,there are reports of abusive behavior by men pretending to be trans women accessing women only spaces in order to prey on vulnerable women.,"in 2012, a predatory man falsely claiming to be a trans woman assaulted two women in toronto women's shelters."
Attack,"1. necessarily, if god foreknows i will do x, then i will do x.",1. i will do x if and only if god foreknows that i will do x.

Support,universalizing healthcare reduces social inequalities.,universal healthcare results in improved primary care quality and access in deprived neighborhoods.
Attack,many of the political promises that president trump made failed to manifest into reality.,"with the republican tax plan , which was passed in december 2017, president trump delivered on his promise to lower the corporate tax rate and bring tax cuts for working americans."
Support,"unless seconded by independent medical experts, the conclusions of the consulta medica cannot be considered objective or unbiased, as they are affiliated with the vatican.","only three of the five members of the adjudicating panel of doctors need to agree in order for a recovery to be considered medically inexplicable. this implies that potential medical explanations are disregarded , simply in favor of the majority vote."
Support,"he has withdrawn america from many international treaties , agreements and accords.","this does not include his questioning of the imf to which he also perverts the purpose , who, or withdrawal from the international arms trade treaty , among many others in the past 18 months."
Attack,the government is complicit in deepening stratification by allowing private clubs to maintain expressive association and exclude people based on social standing.,any legislation that attempted to dictate how people choose to associate in private clubs would violate the first amendment right to freedom of association .
Support,many other figures in the new testament identify jesus as the messiah.,"after the crucifixion, cleopas refers to jesus as a prophet. jesus of nazareth, which was a prophet mighty in deed and word before god and all the people. luke 24:19"
Attack,"if time does not have a start, which would contradict current thinking and major theories, nothing never existed because time, pre time, prototime or some other pendant was always running.",the nature of time requires that something else or underneath time exists because otherwise there is no change in time: something such as entropy has to change to enable time to exist. it is not explained why that and or time would exist.
Attack,ukraine has arguably improved the geopolitical status of itself and its allies in recent years.,ukraine has severed diplomatic ties with several nations due to their support for russia.
Attack,"there has never been legislation, philosophy, or religion that can stop an evil person from acting their evil out.","while these constructs cannot literally prevent individuals from committing crimes, they lower the overall crime rate and promote security in society."
Support,people with massive wealth can influence the economy and society; their heirs may not be well suited to handle such responsibility.,people with immense wealth participate in government lobbying to ensure their interests are met.
Attack,"those morals would by definition not be objective since they would depend on the whims and views of a person that creator . to be objective something must be separate from personal perspectives and views or context independent. in the case of a person making a virtual world, those morals would be arbitrarily chosen by that person making them dependent on their feelings, views and perspective and therefore would be subjective.",this may be true and hold for the given example but not with god. his morals are not arbitrarily chosen. they are part of his nature. he can t change them or choose them. they are who he is.
Attack,"humans have the ability to act in accordance with higher ethical principles, even when they may not desire to do so in the moment e.g. telling the truth even though it is personally disadvantageous",a study on rats at this university shows that non human animals are capable to making decisions based on more complex emotions. the study found that rats avoid very tempting food when they know that a fellow rat will be released from an enclosed space for doing so.
Attack,there are better alternatives to helping refugees than for high income countries to take them in.,the only way to achieve a long term solution to the problem is to offer refugees permanent asylum in high income countries.
Attack,"fairtrade provides producers with a minimum price guarantee , which means that farmers are able to have more secure and stable incomes.","fairtrade standards only guarantee the minimum price to farming co operatives , which has been diverted from poorer individual farmers who would have otherwise received the extra support."
Attack,millions of mice are poisoned in grain storage facilities every year and millions more are killed during 'mice plagues' that often affect crop areas.,"poisoning pest animals is on its own an ethically questionable farming method due to both the deaths of animals and potential health effects on humans , and one which ethical and organic farms may choose not use."
Attack,the transition between a meat eating world and a vegan one could be made gradually and special attention could be paid to those harmed by the change.,those who suffer as a result of large scale economic restructuring are often ignored and do not get the support they need.
Support,"dr. ian stevenson , dr. jim tucker , and bhikkhu analayo have scientifically researched rebirth and amassed a considerable amount of evidence of mental or physical attributes being carried between lives.","the buddhist concept of rebirth does not involve a supernatural soul and, as such, is well suited to scientific investigation."
Attack,"many zoos conduct sessions that educate visitors on habitats, behaviors, and safety concerning certain animals in the wild. this information can be life saving, and thus important.","the probability that this information will actually beneficially impact someone's life is minuscule, and probably outweighed by the probability of an accident at the zoo itself."
Attack,"article 14:3 states: 'freedom to manifest one's religion or beliefs may be subject only to such limitations as are prescribed by law and are necessary to protect public safety, order, health or morals, or the fundamental rights and freedoms of others.' thus circumcising a child takes away this freedom without any of these limitations being present.","circumcising a child may not be limited under article 14:3, since circumcision does not violate any of the applicable limitations."
Attack,"design thinking is not considered the only way to solve a problem, but rather an option of addressing a specific set of problems.",design thinking is currently treated as a ''silver bullet' suggesting other approaches are less viable.
Support,humanity is becoming increasingly capable of addressing environmental concerns through technology and innovation to ensure its survival.,the collapse of the environment does not eliminate the possibility of creating human engineered environments with selected desirable species.
Support,"in the most world renowned cuisines, meat plays a central part and is often the highlight dish.","bacon. whenever there is a debate about not eating meat, bacon is quite a strong argument for the case that eating meat brings more taste and pleasure than most plant based foods."
Attack,the bible is the word of an all seeing and perfect god. the meaning behind these words cannot thus be outdated.,"the earliest accounts in the bible were passed down orally for generations before becoming a part of it. as such, it is highly likely that they evolved to apply to the specific cultural circumstances at the time, rendering them less applicable today."
Attack,"we are justified in rejecting unfalsifiable claims is not, itself, a falsifiable claim under this view. therefore the argument defeats itself.","consider the consequences of not rejecting unfalsifiable claims in general. if they are not bad then the justification has been falsified. thus, we are justified in rejecting unfalsifiable claims is a falsifiable claim."
Support,star voting encourages candidates to campaign positively.,more honest campaigning better represents the people's wishes.
Support,"while in the caliphate of córdoba different religions coexisted, that society was very stratified. ethnic arabs were at the top of the social hierarchy, higher than jews and christians, who had to pay a tax supporting wars against christian kingdoms in the north of spain.","the peaceful coexistence between muslims and christians in spain was stopped by the reconquista , a continuous phenomenon by which the christian iberian kingdoms opposed and conquered the muslim kingdoms for about 780 years, culminating in 1492."
Support,most christian and judaic societies have abandoned the scriptures that go against modern western principles. the percentage of muslims that hold to these anti western ideas is a lot larger than that of christians.,"there's a grave difference between islam and the two other religions. in judaism and christianity the messages from god have always been interpreted by a human before written in the holy scriptures. therefore we cannot trust the text as being entirely in line with what god intends to say. but in islam, the koran is allah's direct word . therefore muslims cannot deviate from the word of the koran, which means they can never adapt to the western societies' values."
Attack,"there are isolated situations where a homosexual orientation would be more gratifying, such as on an all male ship of sailors at sea or stranded for years at a time.","most people with a homosexual orientation have never ended up in this sort of situation. thus, it cannot explain why most gays came to get a homosexual orientation."
Support,"people are poor as a result of the lottery of birth. therefore, it is not their fault that they do not have enough money to access healthcare.",many people are born into poor families who don't have the resources necessary to enable them to climb the ladder of social and economic mobility.
Attack,"a pardon is an expression of forgiveness . therefore, only those who have been wronged should have the moral right to pardon.","the ability to morally pardon someone does not imply the power to do so legally; thus, while forgiveness can influence sentencing , it does not absolve legal culpability."
Attack,"in the bible, earth is described as having four corners, something a circular platform cannot possess.",the phrase 'four corners ' is clearly figurative language that is still in use today.
Support,"we know how to use an electromagnetic field to make electric power; it's how every generator works, so the principle has been thoroughly studied, and it looks nothing like the pyramids.","a generator that turned the earth's magnetic field into energy would have to move through that magnetic field, turning the kinetic energy used to push it into electric power. the pyramids are stationary stone structures."
Support,the assumption that people will invariably be motivated by self interest is itself only conditionally true but presented as universally true.,people very often are motivated by others interest. this is generally ignored in most economic theories and in game theory.
Support,many hindus report being comfortable integrating scientific findings into their religious belief.,"hindus do not perceive a conflict between their religious beliefs and science; for example, most hindus accept the theory of evolution ."
Attack,members of certain religions believe that disobeying the rules of their faith will lead to eternity in hell. this is a greater harm for them than minor impacts on the jobs market.,that some people unfoundedly believe in hell is not a sufficient reason to discriminate against others who do not.
Support,"transumanism may cause people to live unnaturally, and excessively long. this can have massively negative effects.","this can exacerbate the problems with overpopulation and overconsumption, leading to the destruction of the environment and by extension, possibly the downfall of the human race."
Attack,gender neutral bathrooms could make facilities more accessible to caregivers.,"accessible bathrooms can be designed so as to render caregiver assistance unnecessary, negating the need for gender neutral bathrooms."
Attack,taking in refugees comes with significant financial responsibilities and burdens that make it unreasonable to place the obligation on high income countries.,"in many high income countries, there is public support for spending on foreign aid. this suggests the populations of these nations feel the benefits of spending outweigh the drawbacks."
Support,"agi may react aggressively to preserve its decision making autonomy, acting in self preservation against human intervention.",hackers and cyber attackers can trigger agi to perceive humans as threats.
Support,"the commodification of sex reduces people to sexual objects, thus creating an unhealthy culture.",advertisers use sex because it tends to attract the attention of the audience.
Attack,"with property rights free from extractive government powers, citizens are incentivised to develop new industries that they can profit from.",property rights are guaranteed by the government.
Support,"in the us, several states have passed gender neutral child custody laws . court rulings that grant custody to more women often do so because it is in the best interests of the child because women are typically the primary caregiver .","in the us, 91 of child custody decisions are decided by the parents with no interference from the family court system. in slightly more than half of those cases, both parents agree that the mother should have custody of the children."
Attack,people may be more inclined to favor euthanasia and make less effort to preserve their lives to the end.,"the decision to sacrifice one's life is never trivial . independently of how they choose to do it, inviduals will most always think it through meticulously."
Support,it is important to incorporate young people into the fold of christianity so that the message of christ can pass on to the next generation.,the perpetuity of the faith across generations is more important than minor traditions such as the gender of church leaders.
Attack,"talking about sex in public is considered taboo . asking strangers for sex adds another layer of unacceptability to this, as people may be uncomfortable.","if approaching strangers for sex is normalised, it is unlikely to continue to have a negative impact on individuals' reputations."
Attack,"convictions surrounding different foodstuffs, and their corresponding cultural importance, change over time.",that cultural convictions change does not imply they will change.
Attack,"since practically every life would involve some form of complex problem solving every week, such checking habits would not be difficult to maintain.",how much time people spend really thinking is unclear; that practically everyone does it weekly is a strong assertion.
Support,a homeschooling ban could be enforced in the same ways that other child exploitation laws are enforced.,"most school districts are already aware of the children living in their jurisdiction. therefore, it will likely be easy to identify families shirking the ban."
Support,many democratic countries have monarchies and maintain essential features of liberal democracies.,"according to the freedom in the world survey, all european monarchies are free and have high political rights and civil liberties ratings."
Attack,"within rape culture , women are held to an impossible standard and denied justice. by using existing systems, feminism can make some headway against this injustice, instead of waiting for societal attitudes to shift.","social attitudes that contribute to harm against women often come from normalised violence within society at large p. 3 . by focusing solely on women, feminists do not tackle the source of the issue, so it may continue."
Attack,there is no universal way of combining the key factors into one value. a decentralized anarchist society will probably have diverse ways of valuing things and weighting key indicators.,"that is the purpose of the uua, translating different things into a common value"
Attack,mars would occupy our time to the extent that we wage less war.,"war between terrans and martians could easily be a new possibility. in this scenario, wmd's would no longer be mutually assured destruction."
Support,this argument is hypocritical because united states policy does not value human life in most vital areas of state or national policy.,millions of people have died in war at the hands of our government's military.
Attack,global warming does not present an immediate threat to the lives and welfare of the current world.,short term consequences of environmental pollution could affect the current generation.
Support,"polygyny is only one form of polygamy. there is also polyandry , which does not subjugate women at all.",a woman being married to several male husbands puts the woman in the leading role.
Attack,the audience of the extended universe is different than it is is for the movies and subsequently the reactions to characters in both are different.,there is much overlap in viewers of extended universe material and viewers of this movie. when it comes to the movies as a whole there is even more overlap.
Attack,"cultural and social differences can impact the way economies function, as different societies may place varying values on certain economic activities and behaviors.",imf conditions can provide countries with the political leverage to implement unpopular reforms.
Attack,disagreement within an organization forces it to question its practices and reform for the better.,disagreements within organisations such as the catholic church resulted in fracturing into multiple branches more often than reform.
Support,the international poor are an example of inequality. it is governments which form boarders from immigration and regulate constrict free trade.,"for example: if haiti had no boarders with the usa, there would be vastly less inequality than if joe biden gives the poor in america extra money."
Attack,"in the united states, the first amendment prohibits government stopping expression of belief.",the removal of monuments by their owner does not violate the 1st amendment.
Support,laws prohibiting insult to the head of state aren t limited to just monarchies and are also present in many republics.,publicly insulting the president of poland is a criminal offence under article 135 2 of the polish criminal code . the penalty is imprisonment for up to three years.
Support,multiplayer video games are social activities that often involve cooperating with others online or in person.,"cooperative multiplayer games, such as massive multiplayer online games mmo , often require players to join groups to overcome difficult challenges or compete with other players."
Support,"people with alexithymia may never be able to improve their emotional intelligence, no matter how hard they try.","alexthymia is often associated with externally orientated thinking . as such, individuals with this condition may struggle with the introspection required to effectively learn and practice empathy."
Support,transhumanism helps to prevent existential risk of ai takeover through existential risk reduction .,elon musk's neuralink is a prime example of preventing existential risk. the neuralink enables people to compete with ai by thinking at the same speed as their computation.
Support,refusing pc language takes away a person's dignity.,"the way to not be pc is to offend someone or to treat them differently, meaning non pc people don't treat everyone with respect or don't find the person worthy of something, which takes away their dignity ."
Attack,most people who protest outside of abortion clinics do not engage in threats or abuse.,protests can turn violent without notice. it is then very difficult to control them.
Attack,other historical sources back up claims made in the bible.,"there are few, if any, independent sources that verify the claims and events discussed in the old testament, which makes up a significant portion of the bible."
Support,"palestinians want, first and foremost, a state of their own as palestinian arab people. in 1988 their parliament thus adopted a declaration of independence . ever since, november 15 is celebrated as independence day in palestine.","indeed, among all imaginable scenarios for the region, none is more unpopular in israel and only one is more unpopular among palestinians than a joint state."
Attack,"according to some religious texts, which are core to the social values of many societies, publicly asking a stranger for sex is morally unacceptable.","individuals are better off acting in accordance with their own desires than subverting them to those of others, especially given the lack of agreement amongst and within religions on sexual morals."

Attack,surveillance balloons can be equipped with high resolution cameras that can capture images and videos of people and activities on the ground.,"some online services, such as google maps , already routinely collect images of homes and passersby using vans. images taken from high altitude are no more intrusive than these images."
Support,we are living in an age in which people can manufacture their persona. it is important that this trend is counteracted by demanding authenticity.,"people on social media, such as instagram , are trying to label themselves as hard working, intellectual, travelers, etc. this does not normally correspond to who they really are, as people are generally more complex."
Support,"anarchism, allows any system of governance, collaboration, contract, culture, or law within it, so long as it is voluntary.",you can totally be an anarcho capitalist authoritarian communist if only you will not force contractual membership on those who don't wish it.
Attack,despotism is inherently inferior to democracy due to a lack of legitimacy.,legitimacy can come through performance and the successful accomplishment of political goals that are in the population's interest.
Support,inequality is often a root cause of civil wars and conflicts between states.,inequality between different groups in society can exacerbate racial and ethnic tensions in society. this can result in groups resorting to violence in order to seek redress .
Attack,"both jarrus and koon were trained jedi, whereas leia had never received any training of this kind.","during an interview with rian johnson , he equates her response and use of the force to instinct, much like an adrenaline rush wherein a person is able to perform impossible physical acts to save a life under extreme duress. in her case a midichlorian rush."
Attack,this is likely not a reference to the christian jesus of nazareth.,sanhedrin 67a:14 says that ben stada was hanged likely a reference to crucifixion by the jewish court on passover eve.
Attack,"science doesn't prove that there is a god, and neither does it prove that there isn't a god. therefore, science can't back the certain claim that there is no god.","science works on certain assumptions, one of the key assumptions is positive evidence justifies positive claims. in the absence of positive evidence no claim should be made."
Attack,"cultural differences and historical changes in gender norms, such as those surrounding clothing, are proof that gender is socially constructed.",there is no culture in the world where gender does not exist. this implies that all cultures consider gender to be a valuable concept that they can collectively construct in culturally meaningful ways .
Support,"oftentimes, alt right groups unfairly represent feminists to radicalise young men; the actions or ideologies of various feminist waves have little impact on this depiction.","anti feminist groups use logical fallacies and false claims to discredit the movement. for example, some may use the fallacy of composition to claim that all feminists hold extremist views."
Attack,it may be difficult for schools to accommodate the enormous diversity of culture specific life skills that students might require.,about half of us public schools have a clearly predominant ethnic group.
Attack,"god is described as loving, and yet calls on the soldiers of israel to keep all the women children, that have not known a man by lying with him as the spoils of war. keeping people as spoils of war violates the value of being loving, as such is hypocritical.","even if god did give the command, the reason for taking the woman and children captive were to provide provision without which they would likely starve to death. deuteronomy 21:10 14 details the process for marrying captive women and those who didn't marry would have become servants, but there were rules against mistreating them as well ex 21:26 27, dt 23:15 16 . further his is clear that both widow and orphan are to be cared for dt 10:18 says"

Support,"public education is steadily improving in effectiveness and efficiency, making it more likely that teachers will have the time and energy to teach empathy well.","the advent of new and improved educational technologies make it easier to teach a range of subjects to a high standard, including empathy ."
Attack,there are lots of examples of words only existing in one language.,the global language could incorporate such words. lots of english words are already used in other languages for this very reason.
Support,shareholder elected board of directors determine the amount of a company's revenue distributed as dividends. without more incentive they will look to give more money to top earners.,shareholders' primary interest is profit . higher wages for low skill workers would eat into this.

Support,new and original projects are risky ventures for studios to greenlight in comparison with a widely beloved property such as harry potter.,it is going to be easier to adapt harry potter compared to new projects since there is already guaranteed profit potential from an existing fan base.
Attack,"most human attributes considered to be a spectrum , both physical and psychological, take the shape of a normal distribution curve, within which extreme ends comprise smaller percentages of people p. 14 . this is not antithetical to the essence of a spectrum.","if human sex is taken as a spectrum between male and female, then the distribution is bimodal rather than normal , with a large percentage of people at either end and few people in the middle intersex ."
Support,it is important to leave confederate memorials and monuments up to teach our own painful history.,leaving statues in a public space creates a situation in which citizens are more likely to discuss why the ideas they represented were supplanted by opposing ideas than if those statues were less publicly displayed. this reduces the likelihood that those citizens will endorse ideas that may have evolved from similar ideas represented by the statues.
Support,the european union should not interfere with policies on a national level.,the legalisation of drugs is not an area the eu has competency on.
Support,"paywalls may encourage poor academic standards as individuals are likely to cite work they have not fully read, based solely on the abstract.","citing partial articles may lead to an insufficent analysis of the research methods employed, leading in the long run to the perpetuation of poor quality science."
Support,science would have developed faster without the influence of both church and religion.,"the underlying driver of science is human curiosity, which is not established by religion, but only flavored by it."
Support,genetic disorders may be fixable in the future using various kinds of gene therapies or be substantially treatable using more conventional therapies.,computational based approaches may have the potential to enable better diagnostics and treatment of overall widespread rare genetic disorders.
Support,"agi will happen. therefore this shows a reason why creating agi should be done transparently and cooperatively, and be preempted by laws preventing misuse.",agi is a natural part of the development of informatics and computing science. it cannot be avoided. one thing we must avoid is the controlling of agi by politicians and large corporations.
Attack,"moral behaviours or laws are those which, when consistently applied, lead to observable and testable benefits, such as societal stability.","if morality is based upon achieving societal stability, it could justify outcomes that are not intuitively moral to the majority of people."

Attack,jesus says that we should matthew 5:16 and should not matthew 6:1 4 let our good works be seen to others.,matthew 5:16 is about how the disciples should do good deeds rather than evil deeds so that others can be encouraged by their example when the good deeds are seen. matthew 6:1 4 condemns doing good deeds around others specifically to gain their approval. these passages cover different topics and are thus not contradictory.
Attack,the fact that people can choose to interpret and contextualize facts differently means that there isn't a right ought that applies to everyone.,"a given ought does not have to apply to everyone, only to those impacted by the relevant event. when i feel hungry and i ought to eat because of my suffering , my level of physiological hunger can be objectively observed yet no one else needs to feel hungry the ought applies to me only ."
Attack,"we do deny many of these people rights based on their capacity. people of diminished capacity may not, for example, be allowed freedom of movement or autonomy over things like medical decisions.","even if we deny these people certain rights, they retain other rights despite their inability to participate in the social contract. this shows that rights do not flow exclusively from the social contract."
Attack,gender quotas that do not drive selection of candidates based on competency or accomplishment are unjust.,quotas increase the likelihood of finding qualified candidates by forcibly increasing the resource pool.
Attack,for this statement to be true every animal which is prey would end their lives at the hands of a predator. in fact most survive to experience a natural cause of death.,"every animal is consumed by a scavenger of some kind though, some even microbial in nature, as originally stated. therefore there is little difference between humans eating animals, and other wild life. if it is not immoral for a predator to eat prey, then it is not immoral for humans to eat animals as well."
Support,"without compulsory voting, there is a greater incentive for parties to appeal to voters who most strongly share their political ideology.","more ideologically extreme voters tend to be a lot more excited and thus more likely to vote, meaning they get more influence in selecting a party's candidate."
Support,there is nothing logically contradictory about a world full of free agents who always choose to do good.,"if god is capable of creating one free moral agent who always chooses to do good, then god should be able to create more than one free moral agent who always chooses to do good."
Attack,families with children have a higher rate of life satisfaction than without.,"the relationship between having kids and life satisfaction may only be true in first world countries like europe , where families are economically able to support more children. for those struggling economically, having many kids can be challenging."

Attack,polling numbers show that pope francis is very popular amongst religious people.,"many leaders are popular simply because they appease their base . pope francis should be confronting individuals on matters of faith, and not simply telling them what they want to hear."
Support,increasing the portrayal of gender equality in video games would not eliminate gender specific art.,gender specific art currently exists and such art existed before gender equality portraying art. having gender equality portraying games would not eliminate that pre existing art.
Support,"the purpose of nato originally was to defend europe against russian aggression for these exact reasons. if ukraine had become a member, then this war likely wouldn t have happened.","russia's power has declined, causing putin to adopt a cold war mentality in which russia wants to control former colonies and rebuild its lost empire."

Support,political stability does not inherently mean legitimacy.,non royal dictatorships and other forms of non democratic regimes are also long and stable forms of government and not inherently legitimate or good for its citizens.
Attack,"religion means well, but utilizes fear in order to gain compliance. fear is at the root of bad behavior. religion therefore negates itself as it enforces itself.","other causes of bad behaviour besides fear exist. for example, lust, anger, or greed."

Support,capitalism incentivizes predatory economic practices. welfare is a check on unbridled markets.,"the market, by definition, is an irrational and inherently inefficent entity because it wastes energies and resources in competition that rewards behaviours that are not necessarily good for the society, while the wellbeing of individuals and communities is the ultimate goal of the state."
Support,many government functions cannot be properly performed if free speech is absolute.,"if members of the government can say whatever they wish, they may undermine confidence in the government."
Support,"colonists often set up extractive systems in the colonies, causing them to steadily grow poorer over the period of their subjugation, ultimately causing them to emerge into independence much poorer than they would have been had they never been colonized.",economists have estimated that a third of income inequality in the world today can be explained by the varying impact of european colonialism on the economic insitutions of the countries they colonised.
Attack,"as soon as someone recognizes their ability to change a situation, they are responsible for its outcomes. negligence is as much of a choice as intervening.","it is not possible for an individual to become involved in solving every problem they can resolve, so it is not reasonable to hold an individual responsible every time they fail to act."
Support,equality of skill or ability is neither present nor important in the creative industry.,"it is generally accepted that some artists have more natural talents than others, that enables them to perform better and produce more."
Attack,"as most religions suggest not only that free agency is a reality but also that humans having free agency is of paramount importance to god, it seems antithetical that exercising this free agency requires repenting or forgiveness.",if humans choose to do well then they don t need to repent.
Attack,the term assault weapon is arbitrary and no longer designates a specific type of weapon.,the term assault weapon has been used in gun control legislation before and could be adopted or modified by new legislation.
Support,the welfare state is necessary to sustain the system.,the welfare state could stimulate the economy through government spending in times of economic difficulty.
Attack,relying on mobile phone usage in classroom activities would be unfair.,"in most areas where mobile phones are used for classroom activities, an overwhelming majority of teenagers already own mobile phones."
Support,"this passage cannot refer to jesus of nazareth because jesus was tried for claiming to be the messiah or king of the jews, not for inciting people to worship a god s other than the god of israel.",jesus never claimed there was any god other than the one god of israel.
Support,this means that members of the indigenous group have better access to the artwork that is most significant to them.,having access to this artwork can be a way to promote the culture to younger generations of the indigenous group that may have become distanced from their culture.
Support,saying neither circumcision nor uncircumcision counts for anything is another way of saying it doesn't matter whether someone is a jew or a gentile.,"circumcision was so closely related to the jewish identity, that the word itself was regularly used to refer to the jewish people. likewise the uncircumcision was another word for the gentiles."
Support,vertically farming is healthier than conventional farming.,"different colors of lighting could let plants make more of some nutrients than under normal lighting. 1 , 2"

Support,"laws are more likely to be unjustly biased against women than men, such that any imbalance that feminists may introduce would be limited in its effect.",many women are married or in union before age 18 and can experience a host of negative consequences because of this. they need feminists to fight for them as they are unable to do so themselves.
Attack,"discriminatory behaviour is, by definition, a violation of meritocratic values. a genuine meritocracy will not be discriminatory.","even if an ideal meritocracy would not be discriminatory, aspiring towards a meritocracy can, in practice, produce discriminatory outcomes."
Support,"the turin shroud is evidence of a physical event not explainable by today's science, and consistent with the gospel narration of the death of jesus.","the shroud of turin is the most extensively studied artifact in history. therefore, scientific findings surrounding it are credible."
Support,"the government has a duty to protect its people, especially vulnerable people, from harm.","speech that incites violence should have legislative consequences, as it has both the intent and potential to cause harm."
Attack,"since medicaid provides full or partial coverage for a wide range of medical procedures , including those treating conditions that like pregnancy are a product of lifestyle choices , individual responsibility is irrelevant to whether or not the government should fund abortions.","unlike pregnancy, the treatment of other conditions that are a result of lifestyle choices rarely has a fatal impact on another human's life."
Attack,it can also be assumed that regulating the internet can make communication safer and more enjoyable.,"typical approach to regulation is to deny everything that's not produced for profit in the local market. this prevents most of the safe approaches to global internet communication, and attempts to produce monopoly power to existing market participants."
Support,"the violent actions associated with hate speech are illegal, not the speech itself; therefore, anything that is not directly harmful should be permitted.","promoting attacks against certain groups is incitement to violence, not hate speech. these cases do not depend on having hate speech legislation."
Support,"in 2024, u.s. air force veteran whistleblower jake barber publicly claimed to have been part of a retrieval program describing various information about the program and peculiar aircraft which unlike david grusch he witnessed himself.",the defense department has not responded to the allegations.

Support,"historically, humankind have managed to prevent nuclear wars and will do so in the future.",mankind understands the risks of a nuclear war and is therefore invested in avoiding it.
Attack,hateful people will push their agenda regardless of legality. keeping this speech out in the open makes it easier to monitor what they say and react accordingly.,"most people hold hateful views, not because they have rationally deduced them, but out of emotion and fear. therefore, public rebuttals to their views are unlikely to change their minds ."

Support,"the recognition of rights must consider contextual factors, including their interaction with the rights of others, and therefore, rights are not absolute .",limitations on freedom of speech are similar to justifiable limitations on freedom of movement that prevent trespassing.
Attack,"the bible is not a source of god's revelation. therefore, god does not claim jesus is the messiah.",this claim is based upon the unproved assumption that the bible is not from god. therefore it is flawed logic without first proving that the bible is incorrect.

Support,it is because the taste of meat is so good and popular that scientists try to imitate it and create vegetarian meat products.,"scientists have developed a so called facon , which is a vegetarian bacon."
Support,school children are minors incapable of providing consent . safe sex education is irrelevant when sex involving underage individuals is illegal.,"school children cannot be taught that the law prohibits them from having sex and, at the same time, be educated about safe sex. either the law has to be changed or education on safe sex must be restricted to abstinence efforts."
Attack,"the fact that not all women become primary carers, and many men do take on primary childcare responsibilities , demonstrates that mothers are not forced into caring roles, and can choose to act as they see fit.","individual choices are affected by discrimination , meaning that they are seldom made freely."
Support,school uniforms make it much harder to conceal weapons under baggy clothing.,schools with mandatory uniform policies were found to have 12 fewer firearm related incidents than schools without uniforms. p. 2
Attack,"people voluntarily opt into being controlled by religious doctrine, much like a sports group or social club.","people do not choose the religion they are born into, so it can not be equated with clubs or sport groups."
Attack,the implication of no differentiation between subjects is a single general exam. students could not realistically prepare for an exam where they are tested on all the knowledge they have acquired about everything during that year.,"there can be differentiation of subjects without each of these being constrained to one category arts or science . students could study similar subjects to the current ones, but without artificial limits boundaries."

Attack,many people who believe that an embryo deserves right to life based on it being human also advocate against giving that right to other humans that have already been born based on where they came from.,"there are many pro life organizations that support families, women, and children after birth. some provide money to pay for bills or other costs, like letthemlive . individuals do their part by donating money or service."

Support,globalisation has produced positive benefits for the global economy.,globalisation has reduced poverty across the globe.
Support,"freedom of speech and expression constitute an essential freedom in france. therefore, other countries should not penalize france when its leaders oppose an ideology that poses threats to this right and freedom.","freedom is enshrined in the motto of france: liberty, equality, fraternity, and its first position may imply that it takes precedence over the other two values."
Support,"the act protects employees suffering with mental health illnesses from unfair dismissals , even if they are fired under other pretences.","in 2017 a woman in the uk was awarded 11,000 after her employer was found to have discriminated against her on the basis of a mental health condition."
Attack,there are no people alive today who are connected to confederate era slavery. no one living in the us today suffers from or has suffered from confederate era slavery.,"the values in the constitution, loyalty and allegiance to one's own country, do not change. these statues, not slavery, reflect our values. we do not honor failed traitors whose leaders asked for the state to have a right to continue tyranny against men and women."

Attack,a space elevator would create political conflicts of interest with a nation's own priorities that they value more.,"nations don't have to worry about project conflicts, as they can work on both at the same time. since it's an international effort, each nation's individual input is going to be marginal."

Attack,violence can be used in a good way in order to defend and protect.,there is no need to defend and protect if there is no one attacking. this means men are only solving the problem that they caused.
Attack,"writing off student loans could disincetivize the provision of such loans, which are uniquely structured to be more beneficial than regular loans.","in the case of federal student loans, debt forgiveness is unlikely to have any effect on future lending behaviors, as the decision to write off student loans as well as to sanction loans is made by the same institution: the government ."

Attack,"the right to liberty, also defined as freedom from, is inalienable as we were absolutely free in a pre political state of nature.","a pre political state of nature is not an environment of absolute freedom. in such a state, one's freedom to act scales with their relative strength over others, resulting in tremendous subjugation."

Attack,"the only organization large enough to avert climate change would be all the world's governments acting as one. the evidence is in, not a single one will do what is necessary. therefore, the only solution is to adapt. but many will keep trying expecting a different result.","several nations, albeit small, already implement several key components of what is necessary and some larger more developed ones are not very far from it."
Attack,"it is important to call out and oppose wrongdoing wherever it occurs, and true opponents of wrongdoing would welcome any allies.","to make common cause with a group is to legitimise them, and when the group is just as guilty of the crime that they are decrying, it is morally consistent to condemn both the guilty group and the other crime. thus, one can characterise muslim majority countries' retaliation against france as illegitimate."
Attack,"while the occupation of afghanistan initially caused anti western sentiment, withdrawing would not necessarily ease such sentiment; much damage has already been done.",the taliban strategy relies heavily on the american presence in afghanistan in order to bolster anti american sentiment among potential recruits and the broader populace. without that presence it is likely such sentiments will ease.

Attack,"certain adoption and foster care providers , who disapprove of same sex relationships, have sought exemptions that would permit them to decline service to same sex couples.","there have been examples of adoption and foster care services shutting down because they were forced to cater to same sex couples. it is then likely that enforcing discrimination laws would force these religious organizations to shut down as they would prefer that over providing services to people their religions condemn. and intuitively, more people will suffer if these organizations are forced to shut."
Support,"the process by which presidential pardons are granted is shrouded in secrecy , so there is limited scope to assess whether the reason for a rejection is justified. this leaves room for bias.","pardons are often granted based on subjective standards and criteria, such as attitude or marital and financial stability , which automatically disadvantage marginalized communities."
Support,"on the vast majority of dating apps, such as tinder, people tend to select potential dates based mainly on physical appearance.","the algorithm incentivizes such selections, showing the most attractive people to other attractive people based on desirability scores . without clothing to hide undesirable physical characteristics, the algorithm may put more emphasis on physical appearance."
Support,"irv is non monotonic, meaning that increasing your support for a candidate can cause them to lose, and vice versa. this is projected to occur in at least 15 of 3 candidate elections, increasing with the number of candidates , based on a spatial model of voter behavior.","yee diagrams demonstrate how off the rails irv can go, with candidates winning even when the average voter is nowhere near them, etc. see video , images , images , images"

Attack,food insecurity can be minimised by using vertical stack farming.,"several important food crops, like rice p. 1 , use the c3 metabolic pathway , which breaks down at higher temperatures . this may make vertical stack farming inefficient, as it requires lots of energy to maintain ideal growing temperatures."
Support,"conventional methods find financial success with a crop like lettuce , then vertical farms have a chance at being financially viable when implementing the crop themselves.","if conventional methods find marketing success with making unknown foods popular first like quinoa, amaranth, fonio, and teff , then vertical farms might find similar success."
Attack,"if personal finance is merely an elective, many students might decide not to take the course for fear that it is not academic enough and would therefore hurt their chances for college admissions.","the maniacal curation of college applications is a uniquely us phenomenon. thus, this is not a reason that life skills classes should not be offered in the rest of the world."

Attack,god could apply salvation to unbaptized infants the same way he could apply salvation to adults who have never heard of christ.,"while he could do so, we should never assume that he does. it's always better to follow the pattern laid out in scripture by baptizing and teaching everyone we can reach."
Attack,"legalizing marijuana would remove the feeling of wrongdoing, allowing people to experience better mental well being when smoking.","the wrongdoing feeling of smoking shouldn't be removed. even though tobacco is legal it is still highly related to cancer, heart diseases and others. people that smoke should be aware of the consequences it brings. same goes for marijuana."

Attack,the bread from a hot dog is effectively split into two in a similar manner to many well known sandwiches.,"by this definition, all foods with some edible substance packed inside connected pieces of baked goods would be considered sandwiches. this includes burritos , calzones , or filled donuts. however, this is not the case."

Attack,"substance dualism does not imply human telekinesis. in an entity composed of both mind and matter, that mind may be limited to affecting that matter. the individual human mind may be limited to affecting the individual human brain as an inherent substantial form and not an emergent property.","that's just telekinesis with a very short range. we have no physical evidence of this, despite considerable research."
Support,"research has examined animal cognition in mammals e.g. primates, elephants, dogs, cats, horses, livestock etc. , birds including parrots and pigeons , reptiles lizards and snakes , fish and even invertebrates including spiders and insects . thus humans are not unique in having a developed brain.",cephalopods are generally regarded as the most intelligent group among the invertebrates and have a variety of cognitive abilities .
Attack,"according to the materialist view, the metaphysical mind is reducible to the properties of the physical brain and is thus accessible to scientific investigation.","while the brain is a physical object, and is thus governed by the laws of science, it merely responds to the experiences felt by the mind. science does not currently have the capacity to investigate the mind as a separate entity ."

Attack,"mutations can explain the loss of genetic information but can't explain the development of new features requiring specific genetic coding. whale evolution is championed by linking unrelated species over supposed geological time. the development of tail flukes and blow holes is unexplained. the best explanation is the story telling of the evolution of the blowhole, for example, might have happened by... this is not science or fact but speculation of a philosophical nature.","toy models explicitly show how randomness selection leads to the appearance of new, original, adaptations. this is the premise of the field of evolutionary algorithms , which have been employed with success."

Attack,"young adult literature has been criticised for being unbearably dark , featuring issues such as sexual abuse, racism, domestic violence and shootings.","it is questionable to criticize this in the face of the challenges that today's young adults face, for example with an eye on their economic prospects and threats like climate change. dark young adult literature may simply be a reflection of the times."

Attack,"the effect size quoted in this study is too small to be clinically meaningful, which makes their conclusions tenuous at best.","the sample size is far greater than is necessary to reach saturation the point at which the sample size no longer makes a difference to the results provided via said study . therefore, the effect size isn't an issue for this particular study, as a more than adaequate sample size was consulted to produce these results.statistic solutions; additional studies on linked page"
Attack,"changing humans, society and socioeconomic systems such that the risks of misaligned artificial intelligence are substantially reduced is extremely difficult and time consuming.","they don't necessarily need to be changed, for example ai could possibly also be decoupled to some extent from the surrounding society within which it is developed and used. an example just for illustration purposes is that one may prohibit ai being built with goals or primary goals like maximizing a company's profits. this still requires seeing ai not as some kind of separated entity but as part of a broader context."
Support,following vodou has positive benefits for the individual.,vodou supports the reclamation of personal power and agency over one's life.
Attack,farming animals has severe impacts on the local environment due to its heavy resource use and impact upon the landscape.,there is no moral imperative for the environment to remain in stasis or for us regard it as 'fundamentally' in need of preserving so. heat death awaits the entire universe.
Support,the term god is unscientific and unconstructive since it only conceals what is being discussed or referred to in debate and in theoretical ideas and cosmological models: using the terms of those concepts instead is adequate or necessary.,the term god in religious views refers to an intelligent divine creator of the universe and or everything e.g. sequential universes and or parallel multiverses that exists or has ever and will ever exist.

Support,the list of potential tipping elements have continuously changed with various additions and removals which proves that tipping points are not an objective measure to gauge the extinction of the human race.,"explaining the complexity of the human world in terms of scientific models , such as tipping points, suggests a return to climatic determinism that simplifies our understanding of human environment relations."

Support,"if eating meat is immoral because animals feel pain, then eating plants may also be immoral. scientists have been applying the strategies of animal behavior research to plants and finding that plants share many of the characteristics of animals including an awareness of their environment, of injury pain , memory non genetic , and the ability to communicate. if consuming beings that feel pain is immoral, and both plants and animals feel pain, where does that leave us?","the alternative to eating meat on ethical grounds is eating plant based material. plants, though, are life forms too. there is no alternative in which one eats inorganic matter or avoids killing. it is arbitrary and reductive to state that human life matters, and less complex animal life matters, but still less complex plant life does not. consuming other species is inherent to human existence; it is naive to congratulate oneself on only killing and consuming a certain variety of life."
Attack,selling weapons to ukraine would be a violation of the treaty on the non proliferation of nuclear weapons npt .,the us has withdrawn from several non proliferation treaties in recent years. any transfer of arms to ukraine would be ethically justifiable as it would not violate international law.

Attack,"that just resurfaces the problem that changing to a novel system could and likely would itself be slower, without wholly answering it.","if a current model solved 20 problems to 50 by 2100 without a societal transformation and with a societal transformation 20 problems would be solved with regulations to 20 by 2050 and then to 90 by 2100 due to the speed up of problem solving in the novel model along with an extra 100 problems solved by 80 , then the scenario of also transforming the societal model is preferable."
Support,"during the 1920s, western society admired islam, or an idealized version of it that was in fashion then, while today anti muslim sentiment is rampant.","the european islamophobia report defines islamophobia as anti muslim racism , and observes that it has been on the rise since 2015 and poses a danger to muslims living in europe."

Attack,"one of the most common ethical concepts is the golden rule: do to others what you would want done to you. murder, theft, rape, adultery, and lying are wrong, whereas respect, charity and protecting the weak are good because we look at these situations and consider how they would affect us if we were in them.","many cultures do not believe that murder is wrong, many cultures have had ritual murder for centuries. this would indicate that this belief is not inherent, and does not transcend cultures and time universally."
Support,"anarchism, allows any system of governance, collaboration, contract, culture, or law within it, so long as it is voluntary.","groups, cultures, institutions, investment schemes, and other schemes can arise to reduce most of these inefficiencies."
Attack,"words can be taken in several ways. but they should be taken in the way that best seeks to understand the intention of the author, st. paul. the author makes clear that he does not mean the resurrection body is only metaphorically for ethical behavior, godly of heart .",the author's intent can be summed up that he trying to describe the resurrection resurrection body. what is being contested is that author is implying either a non physical resurrection or a physical resurrection. concluding that it is clear that the author affirms one side over the other is to ignore the entire branches discourse on the issue.
Support,"leia survives instead of getting a satisfying and relevant send off. as carrie fisher is dead, this effectively relegates the character to background appearances in the future movies which is anything but satisfying for such a major figure.","not only it would be an act of respect to end leia's life on star wars on that moment, there is also weak evidence that leia will be relevant for the next movie in the context of the narrative showed by the end of the last jedi."
Support,women are more successful in losing weight if their partners express satisfaction with their current body.,"when society treats obesity as unacceptable , it is less likely that women will receive this validation from their partners."
Attack,"in john 2:20 21, body could mean a spirit in a physical form, not necessarily a physical body.","the word for body in this passage, soma, virtually always means physical body in the gospels, and there is nothing in the context of this passage suggesting it has an alternative meaning."
Attack,"this is not a true score voting system, but a shouting match, which the party with the loudest voters won, even if there were not as many people in that party .",the same fewer but more passionate principle applies to a scenario where 40 vote their candidate 9 while 60 vote their candidate 5 averaging 3.6 vs 3.0

Support,inequality will persist and worsen without the application of chatgpt.,"chatgpt can improve access to critical information and services for underserved communities in sectors such as healthcare, education, and social services ."
Attack,"prayer, akin to talking to oneself, can reinforce harmful ideas or behavior e.g. bigotry found in religious doctrines, violent ideologies, tribal dogma .",talking to oneself may also help a person examine their own thoughts and improve them.
Support,"education and learning beyond the classroom rely to an increasing degree on the use of mobile phones. students should, therefore, become familiar with learning with, or through mobile phones.","language learning services such as duolingo and lingodeer work, first and foremost, through their apps."
Attack,these riots resulted in a significant loss to the capitol.,an early assessment of the damage to art in the capitol by curators suggests that the major works of art remain unscathed .
Attack,"making it mandatory adds the unnecessary costs of regulation, enforcement, and policing.","governments could and should take a very light approach to enforcement, and only bother intervening if a child's health is becoming affected."
Support,students can start off in the workforce without issues of overwhelming debt.,student with massive student loan debts might struggle to be independent adults.
Attack,"poe had been demoted. depending on your experience in regard to military hierarchy of command, poe no longer qualified to take part at that level. holdo makes that clear when she corrects his use of the commander title.",this does not contradict the claim. vice admiral holdo does not appear to tell anyone including poe about the plan.
Support,"as men are often more aggressive than women p. 1032 , having more women in the military could reduce the number of criminal offenses committed against hostages, refugees, detainees, and prisoners.",a lack of female comrades can make female officers feel helpless in their efforts to assist women who are being harmed.
Support,"both are base in the same god therefore if one is true then both must be true, but they cannot both be true, therefore they are both false.",the pope said all major religions worship the same god .
Support,russia is likely to retaliate against finland with cyberattacks .,finland has experienced an increase in reported cyberattacks since it applied to join nato.
Support,the ease of access of search engines like google also allows for inappropriate or unsafe content to be brought into the classroom.,"the internet allows for children to access pornography, violent images and other age inappropriate imagery easily . bringing devices which can easily access the internet into the classroom could harm children."
Attack,accepting undocumented immigration undermines the integrity of the legal process and authority of law.,"if people are trying to flee the dangerous countries they are from, it should not be so difficult for them to get into and stay in the us."
Support,the modern western understanding of what amounts to discrimination does not necessarily correspond to the teachings of a religious text from a different culturo historical context. it is therefore a bit of a stretch to claim that the bible has an opinion on the contemporary discrimination debate.,"discrimination can be defined as the practice of treating one person or group of people less fairly or less well than other people or groups . modern lawmakers can posit that refusing a specific job to someone means treating them less fairly well, but the bible does not necessitate this inference."
Attack,native docker containers on windows are supported for windows server 2016 and windows 10.,just because they are supported doesn't mean that linux's aren't better.
Support,biblical characters sometimes have more than one name.,"the father of zerubabbel was pedaiah 1 chronicles 3:17 19 but also shealtiel ezra 3:2, 8 , 5:2 nehemiah 12:1 , haggai 1:1, 12, 14 , 2:2, 23 , matthew 1:12 , luke 3:27 , which are two names for the same person."
Attack,"royal marriages are characterized by infidelity , so the public is not justified in their disapproval of king charles, based solely on his infidelity to princess diana.","princess diana is likely the most beloved member of the royal family in history. therefore, it is reasonable that charles' affair evoked a strong reaction from the public."
Attack,the happiest countries in the world are capitalist .,social class structures which are typical in capitalist countries are associated with increased depression and anxiety .
Support,"being able to create a world one wants to live in could be too good to be true, as that could come at the sake of other lives due to intentional designing to fit a creator's needs.","due to building and trying to create a perfect suitable world to live in, it could possibly set off a chain reaction that ends up negatively impacting others in the future through the butterfly effect ."
Attack,if free will necessarily entailed evil then god could not have free will unless he too could sin.,"since god is omnipotent, god has the capacity to sin, but chooses not to do so."
Attack,masks will not prevent people from contracting or spreading the disease in other ways.,"wearing a mask helps reduce the propensity for people to touch their faces , which is a source of infection, particularly for individuals who do not practice proper hand hygiene."

Attack,government can more easily regulate the quality of healthcare in government agencies than they can of private companies that exist in an open market.,a market based healthcare industry and government regulation are not mutually exclusive.
Support,allowing countries to restrict hate speech in certain cases would reduce the frequency with which people see certain offensive ideas.,"when donald trump was banned from twitter over the january 6th riots, his mentions on social media decreased significantly ."
Attack,"there are principles on which moral truths are grounded. each subjective interpretation of these principles attempts to exemplify the principle but cannot do so perfectly. this explains perceived variation of morality cultural or otherwise , despite the existence of said principles.",subjective morality changes too much over time to be based on something unchanging like objective truth.
Support,"in the usa, women's voting began to be recognized in 1848 with the seneca falls convention .",women in the us were granted the right to vote in 1920 .
Attack,"that is a false dilemma and so is the conclusion. however, your claim about working conditions are probably correct in many cases. but when looking at what it takes to decrease suffering for laborers eg increase wages, rights to organize, improving working conditions versus for animals e.g. stop eating industrially produced meat and only eat free grazing wild game it is clear that abstaining from eating meat is the more reasonable and sustainable action.",this is to suggest that reducing animal suffering is more important than reducing human suffering. morality demands that the life of the enslaved vegetable farmer is of more value than the life of a farmed chicken.
Support,"working late night before school nights could lead to an increase in stress and less sleep, all of which contributing to less development potential for a minor. work experience for minors should be gained through the use of manageable hours, not through the use of late night and early morning shifts which lead to a higher negative impact and less experience gained compared to normal hours.","according to a study conducted by the cdc reported on by the apa , stress, depression, sadness, feelings of hopelessness and suicidal tendencies have increased in school children by 40 . by relaxing these labor laws and opening the door for a higher workload to be placed on school children, this number is likely to increase."
Attack,having a child is selfish as it places a burden on others in society.,"though they may be a burden initially, most children eventually become adults who contribute to society and bear those burdens as a net benefit to society. these individuals make sure that both the aging and next generation after them are supported."
Attack,a personal vehicle is the most expensive personal possession that can easily be stolen; drivers are at greater risk of being carjacked than pedestrians are of being robbed.,"each year in the us, there are about 35,000 carjackings p. 1 , while there are over 1.2 million robberies p. 1 ; people are overwhelmingly more likely to experience robbery than carjacking."
Attack,"it would be politically unviable for the us to completely cut off its aid to israel, as most us voters are staunchly pro israel. given this, israel still has plenty of room to be intransigent and aggressive in reaction to the recognition of palestine.","israel could be made to feel its dependence on the united states even without a complete cut off of relations. in 2004, the american government threatened to exclude israel from the f 35 jet program, reducing its capacity to update its jets."
Attack,this is a weak argument; it could be used to justify dismissing anything jesus said as a fabrication if it fits with the later christian message.,skepticism is required to get at the truth to prevent one from being fooled or fooling oneself. that one wants something to be true is a reason to be skeptical of it.
Support,pope francis has been complicit in the cover up of and corruption around the church's sexual abuse.,pope francis covered for a serial predator by removing his suspension and consequently putting the catholic community at risk.
Support,socialism is generally about equality of opportunity and equality of outcome. this means that there's an inherent incentive to ensure an increased average income.,"for example, a 'living wage' is a wage which would allow for any one person to survive in an economy with all the needs being meet without having to work several minimum wage jobs. it is therefore fair to assume that the 'minimum wage' would increase, or that the cost of living would sink due to an increase in free public services."
Support,civil disobedience can lead to societal improvement.,it can help keep an important subject in the media agenda and public attention and to communicate a notable stance on such.
Support,a carbon tax places a higher burden on those with lower incomes .,"one prominent estimate , developed by an interagency working group of the united states government, is that carbon dioxide emissions impose social costs of about 40 per metric ton, the brunt of which would be borne by lower income households."
Attack,"the people who work in slaughterhouses likely do not care about killing animals, so employing them to do that is not mistreating them.","studies have shown that working in animal slaughterhouses leads to desensitisation to suffering and violence in general: abattoir workers have aggression levels comparable to those of incarcerated people, and towns with abattoirs have higher rates of domestic violence and violent crimes including murder and rape. this suggests not only that the meat industry harms worker psychology, but that it indirectly harms the wider human population as well."
Attack,atheism is an assertion that no deity exists of course it needs to be justified. especially since science admits that it cannot prove a universal negative.,"we do not know yet is more rational, but there is not a god is not necessarily more rational. both are pretty strong assertions."
Attack,"we absolutely have the ability to feed all of them, which can obviously be seen by the fact that we are feeding almost all of them right now, given that very few people in the world starve to death.",the statement that there are very few people in the world that starve to death is a gross understatement and incredibly false. over 9 million people die from starvation per year as calculated in march of 2017. world hunger is an epidemic.borgenproject.org
Support,meditation can be incorporated into exercise to enhance the physical and mental benefits of sport.,"by incorporating meditation into exercise, the benefits of meditation may be accessed by those who are not otherwise interested in the spiritual component."
Support,regulations on free speech can prevent companies from lying to customers.,nike attempted to claim 'freedom of speech' as a defense in court after it was accused of lying about working conditions in its factories.
Support,"the prophecy in mk 13:2 mt 24:1 lk 21:6 predicts the destruction of the jerusalem temple. therefore, the synoptic gospels must have been written at a time when the temple was already destroyed, or its destruction was imminent. the first jewish war took place 65 70 ad, and resulted in the destruction of the temple. therefore, the gospels were not written before 65. assuming jesus died in 33 ad, that's a gap of at least 32 years.","mk knew the temple had fallen or was about to fall, and the temple fell in 70ad, therefore mk must have been written during or after the first jewish wa r."
Support,"exchange plays a crucial role in the human society, whilst it is not as integral in an animal's society.","exchange plays a crucial role in even the simplest foraging societies. in virtually every foraging group that has been carefully studied, food is shared widely in the band. specialization and exchange are fundamentally cooperative. except for the simplest exchanges, there is a time lag. . evolution of human uniqueness, the spanish journal of psychology, volume 19, january 2016 ."
Attack,"if one sex was superior, it seems strange that evolution has seen it fit to have a 50 50 distribution.","on average, there are 105 males born for every 100 females , which is not a 50 50 distribution."
Attack,"compulsory religious education could be balanced by sociology and citizenship lessons, to provide children with secular ideas as counterparts to the religious ones.",the mere fact that a subject matter has to be balanced with other lessons is reason enough to limit it in the required curriculum.
Support,gerrymandering negatively affects political representation.,states such as ohio have had bipartisan support in redrawing districts after recognizing how unrepresentative gerrymandered districts were.
Attack,research indicates that global warming can be stopped or depending on the policies adopted even be reversed in the long run.,greenhouse gases stay in the atmosphere for an extraordinarily long time. a 2021 climate model study suggests that global warming will continue for hundreds of years because of the gases already in the atmosphere.
Support,"by diversifying their options for education, private schools enable children to access a greater variety of opportunities.","banning private schools would in effect translate to a ban on religious schools, a direct attack on religious freedoms."
Attack,"the classical god is apparently an imagined god who is infinitely powerful, perfect, immortal, moral, etc., with all the ideal qualities imaginable.",this qualities aren't related to the knowability of god's existence.
Support,science is of admitted human construction and possesses mechanisms to account for and limit human error whereas various theistic religions claim to possess supernatural origins and are therefore weakened by evidence to the contrary,"replication of results, control testing and peer review are all key components of the scientific method which serve to limit human error."
Support,the poor are only able to reap extremely limited benefits of economic growth.,"in mozambique , for each percentage point of economic growth between 1996 and 2009, poverty only reduced by 0.26 percentage points."
Attack,beauty standards are based on differential sex attributes that indicate that whether an individual would be a good mate.,"beauty standards that are unrelated to sex, such as skin color , are widespread."
Attack,an agi will be as harmful as the humans who design and build it.,the notion that artifacts embody values has been widely discussed in academic circles for decades. this does not mean that an agi would be as harmful as the humans who create it per se. instead it suggests that potential exists for artifacts to embody the values of their creators.
Attack,"humane farming still necessitates slaughter or mutilation. as such, it does not meaningfully reduce the suffering inflicted upon animals.","hunting, if done ethically, can give animals a more peaceful death than they would have experienced at the hands of a non human predator p. 183 ."
Support,inconsistencies in the lds church suggest that these teaching might not lead to a universal purpose in life.,"the old and new testament holds that there is only one god, while lds beliefs hold that anyone can become a god. this is a contradiction."
Support,"some people lack the emotional skills to endure rejection and may react irrationally as a result, particularly given they're likely to be publicly embarrassed.","men turned down by strangers for sex may become violent , particularly as they are socialised to be angry or abusive when rejected."
Attack,there is no evidence to support the assertions of jainism.,jainism rejects the concept of god as contradictory and lacking evidence.
Support,nazis in the shadows pose less of a threat than nazis getting elected.,"an australian senator, fraser anning , was elected with just 19 votes and would still be unpopular except he used a term from the nazi party, final solution , during a speech that apparently praised the white australia policy."
Attack,2 peter 3:8 does not say that there are any limits on where else this passage provides guidance. you have to want to not apply it to genesis for it to not apply to genesis because the text does not limit its application.,2 peter 3:8 does not refer to or imply a relationship to genesis.
Attack,"private schools can offer more pioneering and creative ways of learning than public schools, as well as specialist subject teaching.",public schools can make specialized or personalized educational techniques available if they are provided with the same amount of money and resources as private schools.
Attack,rastafarianism has often been scapegoated for violence by police and other groups.,"in 2001, a group of militant rastafarians burned down a catholic church in st. lucia , killing several parishioners."
Support,"although islam promotes equality in submission to allah , it also encourages traditional gender roles , suggesting that men and women are not equal.","feminists believe in gender equality and oppose traditional gender roles , such as a submissive role for women pp. 2 3 ."
Support,"with an infinite amount of time to accrue money, and without social leveling mechanisms such as the inheritance tax , the rich would become unfathomably wealthy, creating further social inequality.","technology is not equally available. this means that people born into wealth would be the ones to live forever, leaving future lower income generations to cater to the needs of the immortals"
Attack,the scientific method depends on a notion of causality that depends on a deterministic universe.,"science requires many different kinds of choices, judgments, and interpretations of cause and effect relationships, which means that it cannot depend on a strict kind of determinism that would make these kinds of choices impossible."
Support,usaid has developed afghanistan's road infrastructure.,"usaid has invested in the construction and rehabilitation of more than 2,000 kilometers km of roads to propel travel and commerce."
Attack,the buddhist concept of rebirth relies upon supernatural causes that lack evidence .,"some modern schools of buddhism, such as triratna , do not support the doctrine of literal rebirth, instead teaching the concept as a spiritual metaphor."
Support,this topic can be already be addressed in classroom contexts outside of an lgbt curriculum.,topics of prejudice and discrimination are already often taught in language arts and social studies classes.
Support,military experts have argued that presidential pardons for war crimes disregard the established chain of command and override the decisions made by the responsible military authorities.,"commanders are morally and legally obligated to punish those responsible for war crimes . presidents who pardon offenders absolve not only the offenders but also themselves of this moral and legal responsibility , making this a particularly egregious act."
Attack,civil disobedience undermines the social contract .,civil disobedience is a valid expression of concern within the bounds of the social contract.
Attack,much of jesus' life is not documented: his adolescence and early adulthood are completely left out of all nt accounts.,this is offset by the fact that his ministry is heavily narrated.
Attack,farming vegetarian products also directly or indirectly harms animals in the process of crop production and harvest.,"the argument is an example of whataboutism aka tu quoque logical fallacy , and therefore does not directly refute the argument that eating meat is wrong."
Attack,"given that people will be forced to vote, increased turnout will not impact the legitimacy of the political system.","even if they are forced to vote, voters may feel a kind of association or identification with the parties they vote for."
Support,"the majority of people would not choose to use these sites, because the language and methods used in most research articles are generally not accessible to the general public, as they are too technical .","the way that research journals are structured and written is very difficult to understand, and they are not fit for the general public. some believe that scientific papers are now obsolete , and that they should evolve to become more accessible."
Attack,a third gender neutral bathroom could better meet the needs of those outside the gender binary than a single gender neutral bathroom that is open to all genders.,a third gender neutral bathroom would compound the problematic segregation of men and women by further othering those who do not fit within the gender binary.
Support,monitoring everybody s communications instead of targeting the communications of suspected terrorists has caused security agencies to miss real threats to national security. an example of this was the failure of intelligence agencies to prevent the boston terrorist attack.,the collection of too much data can mislead the algorithms that the nsa uses to sift through voice messages to find potential threats and anomalies.
Attack,"major news sources in the us have always been ideologically biased . despite this, they have not been unable to call and report on elections before.","the people's trust in the media in the us has fallen to dangerously low levels . therefore, the media can no longer be seen as representing the people."
Support,bitcoin has a number of features which make it a valuable alternative to traditional currencies. a significant enough proportion of bitcoin's value can be attributed to these applications that its value is not entirely speculative.,"bitcoin gives people the power to withdraw their money from government control. people will want to use it, because no one can take it away from them, due to it being completely anonymous. higher and higher taxes will lead to wealthy people trying to escape the government's budget by keeping their money below the radar."
Attack,it would be difficult to limit the participation to citizens of the country.,"ip address ranges are assigned based on country. a collaborative website could use ip addresses to limit participation to people located within country. given, this doesn't solve for the foreign visitors or illegal residents."
Attack,"studies show that male and female brains develop differently , so single sex schools allow education to be tailored to the unique needs of each group.","male and female brains are not categorically distinct. instead, they are mosaics of characteristics that are typically associated with the other sex. thus, it is brain type, rather than sex, that predicts behavior."
Attack,natural selection will correct for species' overpopulation eventually.,natural selection does not guarantee a favorable outcome for native species and may lead to the extinction of many species.
Support,"although extinction is a natural phenomenon, it occurs at a natural background rate of about one to five species per year. scientists estimate we're now losing species at up to 1,000 times the background rate.","experts estimate that if we maintain the current rate, between 0.01 and 0.1 of all species will become extinct each year ."
Support,"ought can be derived from is because the use of sentiment , virtue and vice should be taken into account.",psychological studies indicate that our perceptions of social situations are intimately connected to our values.
Support,the impact of the earthquakes was not as severe in syria.,"the earthquakes have resulted in the deaths of almost 5,000 people in syria, compared to the 45,000 in turkey."
Attack,off the grid fossil fuel consumers can migrate towards using sustainable grid electricity instead.,batteries and direct wire connections can only replace so much. the remaining chemical based co2 emissions from most utility transport and the natural gas grid would require green hydrogen or related derivatives to achieve a cleaner and more cost efficient solution.
Attack,candidates may misinterpret who their voters want them to give their votes to.,voters will be discerning enough not to pick bad candidates like these.
Attack,mental health benefits are not unique to medical transitions. children who socially transition with the support of their families also experience good mental health outcomes.,"minors who undergo gender affirming processes may lack familial support , which leads to negative outcomes."
Support,mandatory education contradicts the principle of freedom of choice .,schools can infringe on the parents' rights to make decisions about the social and religious upbringing of their children.
Attack,religion led people to do things correctly before science and technology caught up.,where religion led people to do things correctly it was either by accident i.e. despite the unfounded assumptions or where dogma was based on scientific observation rather than other dogma.
Support,the trump administration's approach is unlikely to work and could instead lead to a complicated relationship with pakistan. this is not in the usa s interest.,sour relations with pakistan could lead to the us losing access to key supply routes used for the afghanistan war and make the war costlier to wage from an economic standpoint.
Support,chatgpt has the potential to reduce language barriers.,"chatgpt can translate between the languages that it understands, allowing unprecedented conversation between people who do not speak the same languages."
Support,genetically modifying farm animals to reduce their risk of contracting disease is an ethical practice.,"genetically modifying dairy cows to be born without horns would avoid the need to dehorn them, a farming practice often carried out without analgesia or anaesthesia."
Attack,god caused the universe because matter cannot come from non thinking matter. genesis 1: 1,"if god is claimed to be the cause of our universe, then the origin or cause of god remains unexplained . this proposed answer has no explanatory power in contrast, it makes the question only more complicated and unreasonable . if one e.g. claims god just is and always existed or is beyond time, then the same could apply for our universe or nature or physics and it still does not answer the question."
Attack,faith was an important factor in keeping the american civil rights movement together in the face of a concerted and powerful opposition.,it's impossible to know that people would not have stepped up to lead had churches not done so.
Support,the death star star wars . a moon sized weapon capable of destroying an entire planet.,"though it s only function is destroying planets, there are many rooms in the death star that serve cool and interesting purposes."
Support,minorities can unite behind one candidate with enough votes to swing elections and make demands.,"this could lead to the destruction of the two party system, and a total renewal of politics."
Attack,there is indeed a body of techniques for investigating varied phenomena and acquiring knowledge regarded as the scientific method .,whatever we regard as the scientific method only is by virtue of it being conventionally accepted as such. we cannot know that our method of accessing the truth is the best method of doing so. we can only stipulate and assume.
Attack,it seems likely that the pope would agree to these as he has already decreed that vatican officials must report sexual abuse allegations or they could be prosecuted.,"while the pope has mandated reporting sexual abuse allegations to the church, he has not mandated reporting it to the police ."
Attack,"israel possesses advanced military manufacturing capabilities , enabling the nation to be self reliant for its defense needs.","despite its advanced capabilities, israel's reliance on foreign sources extends to critical components like the engines used in f 15 and f 16 jets."
Support,"water is a fundamental human need, and therefore its accessibility should not be hindered in any way.","access to water is a universal right , it can't, therefore, be taxed."
Support,the well being of sentient creatures is more important than capital.,"capital derives its value from its ability to impact the well being of users. since resources are only as valuable as they are useful to our well being, it is illogical to value resources over the well being of people."
Attack,"mother teresa believed that suffering could be an important religious experience , bringing those she served closer to god. this is a view that is consistent with church teaching.",there is a difference between helping people find meaning in their suffering and deliberately causing suffering to those already in pain. the latter is not consistent with church teaching.
Support,"while it may be the case that men and women are complementary in some facets of life, it does not follow that they are entirely complementary.","the area where these two genders are most complementary is in reproductive matters , which are not reflective of a broader equivalence between them in other matters."
Attack,"specific instances of discrimination within businesses should be handled on a case by case basis, rather than through a blanket policy.","it will not always be easy to identify or prove that discrimination is taking place when there are no or few women in managerial positions. for this reason, it is better to implement a blanket policy that requires some level of gender parity."
Support,"most artists fit in to specific 'styles', genres or 'movements', wherein works of art will necessarily resemble each other, often purposefully.","a key feature of pop music is the presence of simple, looped chord progressions. as such, many songs tend to share the same ones."
Attack,"the paperclip maximizer is actually not very intelligent, as it cannot separate intention from pure words. an ai would be able to understand that maximizing paperclips doesn't come at any cost.","an intelligent paperclip maximizer could understand perfectly well what it was intended to do, while still actually choosing to do what fulfilled its own goal structure."
Support,"if individuals are charming and considerate of each other's boundaries, it may be flattering to be approached by a stranger for sex.","if an individual respects a rejection of their request for sex, the interaction will have little to no discernible negative effects."
Attack,"implementing kill switches on all such hardware would require intrusive legislation and strong collective action, and will not happen by default, so this is not grounds for considering ai x risk easy .","depending on which hardware is required for such most advanced ai, it can be relatively easy when compared to some other difficult challenges or at least far easier ... than to stop or prevent a pandemic or any kind of nuclear war and without legislation being considered intrusive . that such ais can run on any kind of consumer machines hardware is speculation and it's quite likely that at least at first it can't after which safety measures can be taken."
Support,wealthy people have a negative impact on the environment through pervasive overconsumption of fast fashion . the production of these clothes creates a significant amount of pollution and the majority of these textiles eventually end up in landfills.,"this is driving environmental inequality, where wealthier countries that buy fast fashion products don't have to suffer the negative environmental consequences that occur in poorer countries that produce such products."
Attack,archaeological evidence has backed up the existence of jesus.,"the mere existence of jesus is insufficient to establish the historicity of the gospels. to establish that, the details of the gospel's would need to be true. and while the existence of jesus may be factual, there is scant evidence about the actions he was purported to have committed as mentioned in the bible."
Support,we aim to shape our citizens through the education provided by the state that children are required to attend. we can help create the best adult citizens through providing a high quality education.,"an education lacking in either scientific knowledge, or knowledge of arts and humanities is not a high quality education."
Attack,"hamas, the group israel is fighting in palestine, is an antisemitic organization.",hamas's attacks on israel have not differentiated between its jewish and non jewish citizens.
Attack,mixed sex schools may have a greater incentive to actively educate boys on misogyny and gender violence .,"in the us, some all boys schools attempted to educate boys about gender and sex based discrimination in the wake of the metoo movement."
Support,"if a working and probable cosmological model for an eternal universe was created, this would count as evidence against premise 2. thus, the argument is falsifiable.","eternal inflation is a probable and working model for an eternal universe, therefore premise 2 is falsifiable."
Support,"video game frustration, or tilting , can cause users to escalate conflicts and throw or destroy their own property.",throwing controllers is so common that inflatable covers have been marketed to protect controllers from gamer rage.
Attack,"combating monopolies with direct action and non statist political action is easier in a truly free society, whether combating a super market or a big tech giant.","in the absence of states, combatting cartels and monopolies, or regulating natural monopolies, would be difficult or impossible, due to the extreme differences in resources between corporate entities cartels and protest groups. the cartels could use violence, co opt local governance, suppress media coverage etc, exactly as cartels and criminal organisations the world over already do today."
Support,the buddhist concept of rebirth is supported by multiple studies .,"dr. ian stevenson , dr. jim tucker , and bhikkhu analayo have scientifically researched rebirth and amassed a considerable amount of evidence of mental or physical attributes being carried between lives."
Support,"if all citizens are required to vote, there will be an incentive for politicians to appeal to the largest group of people, and thus be more moderate.","in elections with lower turnout, ideologically fervent and passionate voters, who often reliably vote, have a greater ability to sway elections."
Attack,"tiktok has emerged as a platform for spreading misinformation within the us, stifling americans' freedom to think and express their views.",tiktok has robust mechanisms that help identify and combat misinformation.
Support,"while it is true that its effect is dependent on how it is used, the tool enables some harm to occur that would otherwise be impossible or unlikely.","it could be used for manipulation , malicious marketing, and related purposes at scale."
Support,"1. if god existed, this fact would be more obvious.","absence of evidence is evidence of absence only in cases in which, were the postulated entity to exist, we should expect to have some evidence of its existence. the justification conferred in such cases will be proportional to the ratio between the amount of evidence that we do have and the amount of evidence that we should expect to have if the entity existed."
Support,we do not know what they would or wouldn't do and why civilizations likely at least originally far more advanced than us act like they do. we should therefore expect that we can't understand their actions and decisions and so on.,some of them may play games with us or do seemingly absurd things basically for fun or similar purposes.
Support,equal conscription of men and women would significantly weaken militaries.,"men have inherent physical advantages that make them better suited to military service than women, so equal conscription of women would jeopardise a miltary's combat efficiency."
Attack,"greater diversity is not always a positive factor; there is less trust between people in heterogeneous settings, which makes the group prone to infighting, increasing anxiety in gender diverse spaces.",the amount of distrust in heterogeneous communities will decrease over time as people begin to trust one another .
Support,"historical precedent should not be used to judge a nation's present day behavior, as many countries once engaged in imperialistic behavior.",the japanese empire once included most of northeast and southeast asia.
Support,"as palestinians were forcibly expelled from israel, their claim to sovereignty was never legitimately extinguished, so they still have a right to control over parts of the region.","historical records disprove the theory that palestinian arabs fled the state voluntarily or at the behest of arab leaders. instead, they were forced to flee because their lives were endangered."
Support,"even if vampires are evil, the fact that they are does not mean they deserve evil being done to them.","vampires are put in a position, either socially or economically, that strongly encourages them to kill humans."
Attack,planned parenthood has publicised the reproductive health positions of individual political candidates during campaign seasons.,"such publicisation was not accompanied by the express endorsement or disavowal of specific candidates, and as such is allowable."
Attack,"it is immoral for privileged people to have access to good quality healthcare while millions are deprived of it, especially keeping in mind that giving up their current healthcare benefits will be for the greater good as those who cannot currently afford them will be assisted.",inequality is a natural thing. a natural occurrence cannot be immoral.
Support,"mother teresa often worked with dying terminally ill patients. in the absence of a cure for their condition, mother teresa may have only been able to provide psychological comfort, which may have unwittingly sounded sadistic.","mother teresa breathed new meaning and dignity into the suffering of poor people, by stating that they were partaking in the suffering of jesus christ and, in doing so, making the world a better place."
Support,"gender can be considered as both a social construct and self chosen, since it represents a navigation between the individual and society.","self identification should not be the only thing that defines gender, as doing so can have negative implications."
Attack,the protection of vulnerable citizens from surveillance and harm takes precedence over abstract notions of first amendment rights.,"states have encountered citizen backlas h in their attempts to ban tiktok, indicating that first amendment liberties are not as abstract to the populace as suggested."
Attack,"if the species making such a judgment no longer exists, it would therefore be impossible to ascertain a value or for the earth to be better off.","without the existence of humans, the lives of several species could potentially improve. even if humans were the only species that could understand how the other species lives had gotten better, this would not discount the improvement of the quality of life for those species."
Support,"the non pc term illegal is a good example. when one refers to an undocumented person as an illegal, they are using the term as a noun. the crime is considered to render the individual as opposed to the individual s actions at one point in time as being illegal. it implies that a person s existence is criminal . this is a form of dehumanization . using pc terminology instead highlights that they are a person with the same human rights as the speaker.","any time someone reduces a human being to a single characteristic, especially a negative one, they are dehumanizing the human."
Support,"from the moment a government accepts gay marriage, the definition of a couple and thus the constraints of monogamy becomes irrelevant.","the terms couple and monogamy were only relevant due to the previous legal definition of marriage: two different sexed persons forming the root of a family. since marriage has been redefined, it should not exclude those in polygamous relationships."
Support,the gospel accounts of the empty tomb story are highly inconsistent and show clear signs of motivated modification to match with the intended theology and christology.,"in mark 16:5, a seated young man greets the visitors likely the same young man mentioned in mark 14:51 . in matthew 28:2 5 an angel descends from heaven. in luke 24:4 two standing men greet the women. in john 20:12, two seated angels appear only after the tomb has first been examined and found deserted. thus, the story is not consistent across the gospels."
Attack,"gary habermas, in a survey of 3,400 sources surrounding the undergirding facts of jesus life found 12 facts to be considered historical by the majority of scholars. they include:",cherry picking from theists while ignoring skeptics and agnostics can't be called the majority of scholars .
Attack,"in 1 cor 15 :36 38, we read: 36 what you sow does not come to life unless it dies. 37 when you sow, you do not plant the body that will be, but just a seed, perhaps of wheat or of something else. 38 but god gives it a body as he has determined, and to each kind of seed he gives its own body. thus, the resurrection body is not the body that is sown which is like a seed compared to the resurrection body.","seeds have physical bodies, as do the plants that grow from them. while the body that is sown might be different than a resurrection body, this doesn't equate to an ethereal non physical body."
Support,it is unethical to clone animals when we have incomplete knowledge of its potential harmful consequences.,currently the long term consequences of cloning are unknown.
Support,school districts in impoverished areas have more students in need of help yet less available resources. lower per student spending can irreparably damage poor children's futures.,"disparities in resources and funding lead to achievement gaps, so students in high poverty areas have lower test scores, increased absences, and later graduation dates p. 119 ."
Support,"the parent is not making the claim that a maximally great being is necessarily impossible. just that it is possible that it doesn't exist in any possible world. in other words, it may or may not be possible that a maximally great being exists.","excellent. since the parent says, it may or may not be possible that a maximally great being exists, then it agrees with p1 of the ontological argument."
Support,"global warming could slow down or dangerously change the circulation of the ocean , which would dangerously affect all living organisms on earth.","increased rainfall and the melting of ice due to global warming dilutes the salty surface water, and warming further decreases its density. the lighter water is less able to sink, slowing down the circulation and causing the tipping point know as the atlantic meridional overturning of circulation ."
Attack,"feminists are making strides towards equal representation in dangerous, low status jobs.",men are significantly more likely to be injured or killed through the course of their work.
Support,"in 2024, there were some concerns about the sufficiency of commercial airplane manufacturing oversight and such may also extend to the manufacturing of military aircraft and their components such as sensors. multiple incidents were reported by private rather than military witnesses where commercial sensor manufacturing is relevant.","there are reports indicating there are many technical problems with modern military aircraft in advanced countries such as germany , suggesting full understanding of and control over the commercially acquired aircraft is an issue."
Support,"this process does not necessarily prevent those with sinister motives from becoming certified. for example, a trans woman in the uk allegedly used transitioning as a deceptive tactic to assault other inmates in a women only prison block.",the accused would have been unlikely to gain access to an all women prison block had it not been for favorable policies towards trans women.
Attack,there is more suffering and pain if more people die.,"there is no objective way to measure pain or establish the worth of a human life, as it is determined by the subjective values of a culture or group of people."
Attack,"in genesis 19:31 , lot's daughters say that there is no other man left on the earth erets , even though only sodom and the surrounding area was destroyed.","the daughters mistakenly thought that the rest of the world was destroyed, not just the area around sodom."
Attack,jainism is opposed to the inequality embodied in the caste system .,over 40 of surveyed jains expressed discriminatory attitudes towards certain castes.
Support,some controlled diets have been linked to eating disorders.,many so called fad diets have been shown to be unscientific and bad for human health.
Support,"if used in processed foods, people might not care to look at the ingredients.","bugs do not have to be eaten whole, they can be ground into powder and added to flour."
Support,the eu has many laws and institutions which act as checks and balances on government power.,the eu has the power to sanction members which do not adhere to its rules.
Support,the movie sacrificed its narrative and charm for a story line that goes too far in its attempts to appeal to real world discourses about gender.,"there is no major male character who isn't obviously flawed, or not shown in an unflattering light. there is no major female character captain phasma aside who is obviously flawed, or is shown in an unflattering light."
Support,by claiming that things are good and evil necessitates the existence of a lawgiver. there cannot be moral obligation without the existence of god as the ultimate lawgiver.,"absent an ultimate lawgiver, evil is merely a human construct. it does not make sense to use a human construct as an argument against god's existence."
Support,nato's military presence in europe is not offensive in nature.,nato cannot threaten anyone because it's a defensive alliance .
Attack,the queen of the uk is the most expensive monarch in europe but not the most expensive head of state. in 2013 the british monarchy cost taxpayers 35.7 million.,"that is only because the official figure for the cost of the british monarchy excludes a number of costs, including round the clock security, lavish royal visits and lost revenue from the duchies of lancaster and cornwall. considering all these extra costs, the british monarch is likely to be a more expensive head of state."
Attack,many buddhist beliefs have little grounding in reality; such beliefs are likely to be undermined by personal experience.,"some buddhist principles, practices, and metaphysics are supported by modern findings in quantum physics , mathematics , and psychology . this cohesion with reality reduces cognitive dissonance ."
Attack,"in holland, the legalization of euthanasia has led to more people choosing to end their lives.","the article cited is factually misleading. theo boer claims that suicides increased compared to surrounding countries, but boer uses cherry picked data that is deceptive. looking at more complete data sets and actually comparing data across countries proves his claim is false."
Attack,animals are not morally equivalent to humans and therefore do not possess an equal natural right to live.,animals are a naturally occurring lifeform just as much as humans are.
Attack,the fact that clocks read the correct time even after periods of not being perceived cannot be explained on idealism.,"one can posit a supreme being, such as god, who perpetually perceives the clock even when no human is perceiving it."
Attack,"god initially didn't allow the eating of meat, genesis 2:16, 3:18 , and later restricted it under the laws of kashrut thus making meat not part of god's ideal desire for humanity.","however, in the new testament, he removed even the laws of kashrut, which would be odd if eating meat was not part of god's ideal."
Support,"in a communist system, working class rights are protected.","once the capital interest are removed, all workers would gain as much as they produce. they will not have to live through a static salary that does not reflect their hard work."
Attack,"under the status quo, us prisons are a hostile environment, which make prisoners more dangerous and leads to high rates of recidivism p. 193 .","prisons should be reformed, rather than simply implementing the death penalty for those who had no hand in creating the state of us prisons."
Attack,"though they may be a burden initially, most children eventually become adults who contribute to society and bear those burdens as a net benefit to society. these individuals make sure that both the aging and next generation after them are supported.",having children for the reason that they'll grow up to support older members of the community is selfish.
Support,it was not until the rise of christianity that the tolerance for jews in the roman empire disappeared and turned into persecution.,the catholic church preached as doctrine that the jews were collectively responsible for deicide . this belief fostered two millennia of antisemitism and was only repudiated and removed as doctrine in 1962 during the second vatican council. this antisemitism was part of the environment that allowed hitler's rise.
Attack,"the christian bible states that no human being shall be killed by another human being, and that includes abortion.",the christian bible is the product of humans and not of any god in any way.
Support,rigid gender roles prevent many from pursuing happy relationships. those who challenge gender roles in relationships are often happier than those who do not.,"when they stick to rigid gender roles, both men and women can end up feeling unfulfilled and underappreciated in their relationships."
Attack,boltzman brains . a pocket of order is likely no bigger than the observer himself. therefore we should not expect to observe order in a random universe.,"an ordered region with complex chemistry and evolution creates observers with far greater frequency than random chance. therefore we should expect evolved observers to far outnumber boltzman brains, and we should expect to observe order."
Support,sex verification of anyone wishing to enter women only spaces is likely to be invasive and intimidating for all women.,there are serious concerns associated with each of the available methods of sex verification.
Support,inmates can still escape from prison and commit crimes. capital punishment removes this possibility.,"in december 2000, members of the texas seven escaped from prison and went on a crime spree."
Attack,humans are the most successful organism in their population size and variety of terrestrial and extra terrestrial habitats occupied. no other animal can thrive in as great a variety of habitats as humans can.,"population size is not a strength humans have. we are outnumbered by many species, even by cows and chickens."
Support,score runoff would degenerate into score voting because candidates would run clones and try to steal both runoff seats. this cannot backfire because score is cloneproof.,this would turn this method into honest score voting.
Attack,"in 2024, u.s. air force veteran whistleblower jake barber publicly claimed to have been part of a retrieval program describing various information about the program and peculiar aircraft which unlike david grusch he witnessed himself.","the person made suggestions that raise doubts about the credibility, describing being kind of possessed by something during the encounter and psionics where people can call or summon and control uap."
Attack,"people may develop sensors to let them know what is going on to let humans acknowledge what's happening, so they can take action on it to resolve it.","sensors may have issues, being faulty or specific to where they don't pick up everything important. so a sensor may not notify a person when something goes wrong, due to their shortcomings."
Attack,it is not true that moral goodness necessarily relies on the existence of abstract goodness that is independent of god. there are at least two other options. moral goodness may be defined by god s character or be arbitrarily chosen by god.,"in either case, moral goodness is arbitrary, which is unacceptable, as it seems clear moral goodness is not arbitrary."
Support,"without knowing why there are more single mothers than fathers, it cannot be said that women are better than men in this case.",some women choose to raise children on their own. this does not make them better than men.
Support,"foster carers are subject to regular reviews , after they have been approved, to ensure the required criteria are upheld in the long run.",prospective carers must guarantee that the incoming child will be given appropriate accommodation pp. 3 4 .
Support,"as the penis is designed to interact with a lubricated vagina, a dry hand may generate harmful friction.","another consequence of many types of friction can be wear, which may lead to performance degradation or damage to components."
Attack,"despite widespread adoption of chatgpt in privileged nations, the rest of the world would likely end up using less reliable substitutes or having limited access to free chatgpt tools.","as chatgpt is currently a free tool , it is unlikely that people from poorer nations would use substitutes."
Attack,belief in religion often conflicts with empirical observations in evolutionary biology .,"not all religions reject evolution. thus, even if belief often conflicts with evolutionary science, it does not always do that."
Attack,"once a government is given power to restrict the speech of individuals that meet certain criteria, the ability to restrict speech falls to the hands of those evaluating these criteria. the people evaluating the criteria may not have sufficient oversight, and could then use the power to restrict speech in a way unintended by the original restriction.","laws can be made with specificity, defining criteria clearly enough that they may not be purposefully misinterpreted by bad actors."
Support,being presented with proof of the contrary is not always enough to sway the opinions of those who believed false information.,humans are psychologically ill adjusted to changing their minds even when presented with the facts.
Attack,public support of and trust in juries is much higher than in politicians indicating a higher efficacy from random selection than fptp election icpr.org.uk,"multiple jurors are randomly chosen together, which allows a diversity of opinions to be represented during the trial. we don't just randomly choose a single juror to represent the public during a trial. single winner elections for single seat positions such as president, governor, etc. are fundamentally different because only one person is elected."
Support,the case of the colorado baker created a precedent that normalized lawsuits against churches for discrimination.,there have been more lawsuits against churches based on perceived gender discrimination in church leadership since the colorado baker case.
Attack,"there are general or pragmatic standards for earthly wellness, like the stability of weather patterns or the preservation of species, that could be adopted without falling into naive subjectivism.","stability of weather is only good to achieve stable conditions for life, not as a reliable marker of the wellness of the planet unless it is assumed that the objective of the planet is to allow life."
Attack,the watchtower organization has made prophecies that have not come true. this significantly diminishes the credibility of the religion.,"the watchtower has denied that it is infallible or a prophet. thus, mistakes it made in the past do not prove that it is a false organization."
Attack,"a universal language would threaten linguistics and cultural diversity, eradicating the benefits of the latter.",many different cultures speak the same language and yet have been able to retain their cultural uniqueness.
Support,"if someone couldn't have foreseen the consequences and they were rationally justified to act, their action was a moral at the time it was taken.","for example if someone saw an infant being attacked by a dog, and killed the dog to save the infant, but by doing so the owner of the dog committed suicide because the dog was all they had, the consequences couldn't have been foreseen."
Support,"this view is pessimistic. if the parents are optimists, then the act of creating children is not selfish.","parents with optimistic outlooks lead to more effective parenting; children growing up under this outlook have better social skills , which benefits the society at large."
Support,"one study found that, after adjusting for the amount of crime and disorder in a neighbourhood, ethnicity no longer meaningfully affected public perception of the police. this implies that ethnicity itself does not play an important role. p. 8",people's view of the police is most influenced by how they view the level of crime and disorder in their neighbourhoods p. ii .
Attack,"not many would have openly voted for hate crimes and genocide in 1930's germany, however, by popular vote that is exactly what was achieved. this proves that even when someone doesn't prefer hate crimes and genocide, subjectivity allows for it to happen anyway.","the nsdap did not get into power by popular vote; even in the final 1933 election , which was not free and fair, they only won 44 of seats in the reichstag."
Support,"cloning to date has been small scale and, so, could not meaningfully alter the damage done to the planet by humanity.",cloning is unlikely to become widespread given it is only applicable in niche scenarios.
Attack,simple subjective preference is unable to be a standard for morality.,"if there existed a single objective moral law, then it is true that there would have to be a lawgiver that was the source of that law. however morality is intrinsically relative and thus there is no objective moral law and by extension no act that is considered universally evil."
Attack,"the extension of this would be that our biological directive does not justify the slaughter of animals for food. while this may be true for some sections of the first world, vegetarianism is not a model that can sustain the human species worldwide. if you are considering a new paradigm of human nature interaction it would be built on the deaths of millions of people. it would be immoral to trade their lives for an ideology at this point.","global vegetarianism is far more sustainable than meat consumption. indeed the un has said that a vegan diet is vital to save the world from hunger, fuel poverty and the worst impacts of climate change."
Support,"contrary to what critics have alleged, macron never criticized islam. his critique was confined to religious extremism and radical islam, in particular.",macron's condemnation of radical islam echoes similar condemnations from french muslims .
Support,"any publicly funded access to necessary items is usually restricted to society's poorest, and education should be the same.",eligibility for food stamps in the us is restricted to those on low incomes.
Support,equality of outcome reduces the willingness and motivation of people to excel at what they do.,"in the long run, enforcing equality of outcome risks driving away the most innovative and productive members of society which can lead to economic stagnation."
Support,immortality would cause greater social disruption.,cultures may be lost in the shift from a mortal to an immortal society.
Support,equating abortion with murder would cause women to use unsafe methods and put their lives at risk.,toddler homicide rates in the us appeared to go down after the legalisation of abortion.
Support,existing fact checkers have done little to mitigate widespread lying on political issues.,fact checkers often appear highly partisan . individuals who believe political lies may ignore them.
Attack,"thus, what those raised under governments see as a power vacuum, the people of a free land would see as their power. the entire game board shifts as every individual becomes a power sucking vacuum which is always on and has every right to be so long as it isn't over sucking.","while the above claim might be accurate in suggesting the concept of a power vacuum as we know it is altered, there are still conceivable schemes which might navigate there way to some remaining power vacuums, craft power vacuums, or exploit new unexpected power vacuum opportunities."
Attack,"a terminator, soulless machines designed for temporal combat. terminator series","within the timeline, the terminators have only been known to fail against humanity."
Attack,"hard determinism entails contradictions and paradoxes, so a weaker form of determinism that is compatible with free will should be accepted to address these challenges.","even if it is only our rational faculties that we have control over, under compatiblism, this would require us to plan our thoughts, thinking about them before they arise in our mind, which is impossible."
Attack,"culture is always subject to change , and should be free to do so.","decrying cultural appropriation does not obstruct all forms of change, it merely acknowledges that some changes are likely to be negative and should be defended against."
Support,"self expression is often limited by intrinsic factors, such as fear of being judged for wearing unconventional clothing. such fears would not cease to exist in a genderless society.","the risk of being bullied is higher for those who look different . as gender norms are only one cluster of social norms, people would still be motivated to fit in rather than stand out."
Attack,"the last jedi does not speak enough to the personality traits found more commonly in women that would prove essential during a time of war like empathy, compassion and moral support .","it is a good thing to show female characters that can play the same role as a man, without the character having to be turned more feminine."
Support,"for voters who are unlikely to support utilitarianism and that is many of them, at first , using the condorcet interpretation of approval is the best anyone can do to get a better society in terms of initial steps; one can add in a caveat that approval fails condorcet in some circumstances and leave it at that. the voter will quickly discover, if the measure is adopted, precisely what benefits arise from the caveat.","this is still honest, while allowing voters to question and dig into the implications of non condorcet outcomes in utilitarian methods on their own."
Attack,"by their own definitions, socialism is for the wider good while capitalism initially rewards those who control capital in the first place. therefore, socialism provides more good for the most amount of people.",people who actually lived in socialist economies voted with their feet and left. this strongly implies that they didn't feel their needs were being met better in a socialist economy than in a capitalist economy.
Attack,adding a country with a different religious and cultural identity to the eu could have positive effects on europe.,"in a poll, only around a third of people in sweden 36 , the uk 33 and spain 31 said they thought more diversity made their countries better."
Attack,pope francis has a track record of extreme homophobia. his papacy is a clear sign that the catholic church does still not recognize lgbtq individuals as equal.,"pope francis should not unilaterally determine the church's stance on lgbt issues, but rather should change its stance in line with the preferences of other catholic leaders and institutions."
Attack,"we give humans rights because we expect them to respect the rights of other individuals and the laws that lay the foundation for a civilized society. animals are unable to comprehend the rules of society and the impact of their actions and so we cannot expect that they will respect others. this means that animals cannot be held accountable for their actions, unlike humans.","in practice we do hold animals accountable for their actions by killing them if they attack humans. in this way, we dissolve only one side of the social contract."
Attack,"marketing created the image that aspirin is a harmless drug, when in fact there is evidence that it can cause considerable health damage .","when taken responsibly and as directed, aspirin is safe and effective."
Attack,"islam and christianity say god created mankind, however, there is a significantly large amount of evidence proving humans evolved.",some christians believe that the religion is compatible with evolution .
Attack,allowing civilians to carry guns prevents crime and government tyranny.,states that restrict gun ownership have very similar firearm crime rates compared to states that do not restrict firearms.
Support,"in the united states, the people are the government, and the government represents the will of the people or is illegitimate.","president lincoln famously referred to this principle as government of the people, by the people, for the people."
Attack,protecting hate speech is necessary to ensure the democratic rights of all individuals.,governments need not be the actor to restrict hate speech. abuses of power can be avoided if private media and social media corporations can restrict offensive speech themselves.
Support,it is desirable to test out innovations on earth first; it might be a lot easier to do that there than in space.,"any colonies on mars would exist in a dangerous, hostile environment; this leaves little room for error. since innovations are inherently error prone, this makes it desirable to first test them out on earth."
Support,"in terms of culinary traditions, many cultures have adopted ingredients from other regions of the world, to the extent that they seem like staples today.","potatoes and tomatoes both originated in central and southern america, yet are deemed integral in traditional dishes from cultures around the world."
Support,"there is one case where a farmer saw an ufo abduct and kill a cow which he drew and photographed . in another case, a farmer couple witnessed aliens from an ufo abducting and levitating a cow. there likely are further cases.","according to australian farmers whose cattle have been mutilated, it must have something that lifts it up and puts it down and doesn't leave any marks as can be seen there. they, like many others are convinced aliens are the only rational remaining explanation."
Support,scientific research overwhelmingly supports the medicinal benefits of using cannabis.,a study showed the legalization of cannabis reduced the use of prescription drugs which are often harmful .
Attack,the use of the death penalty could lead to the execution of innocent people .,"in criminal court trials, the burden of proof required for a conviction must be beyond a reasonable doubt . this helps to greatly reduce the likelihood of wrongful execution occurring."
Support,"non proliferation perpetuates the existing asymmetric global power dynamics, which is unethical.",non proliferation is a tool used by the most powerful countries to maintain military dominance over other nations.
Attack,"feminism has facilitated historical progress for gender parity, therefore any polarisation caused by the movement is likely to be minimal.","effective system change can be motivated through close monitoring and considerate donation. this is not exclusive to feminism, so change is possible through many approaches."
Attack,"given that some harm from climate change will arise , adaptation is a necessity that should not be deferred.","some climate change adaptations do more harm than good , contributing to worse outcomes later down the line."
Support,"homosexuality is considered as a grave sin in christianity, the largest religion in the world.",there are around 2.3 billion global followers of christianity.
Attack,"how people treat themselves inevitably influences how they affect and thus treat others. for example, parents can be good or bad role models.",obese people can absolutely be good role models otherwise; how someone deals with their health has no impact on how kind respectful they are to others.
Attack,"red meat animals feed on pasture, which requires next to no upkeep. in contrast, farming vegetables requires the use of pesticides that kill massive amounts of insects and or similar measures that kill birds.","dismissing the most destructive example of vegetable farming by citing the least destructive animal feeding practice does not dismiss the best vegetable farming practices hydroponics, intensive indoor growing, etc ."
Attack,"many countries have a national curriculum that its schools must follow, which aims to ensure that all students acquire the same fundamental skills by the time they leave compulsory education.",national curricula are not existent or universally enforced in all areas of the world.
Attack,"the referenced study does not conclude that hormones in general are driven by cultural factors. it only speculates testosterone differences may be influenced by social factors , the study in fact acknowledges that men having higher testosterone is a product of genetic and natural factors .","the study is clear that theres are proven non genetic causes. the view of testosterone as fixed and innate is empirically dubious, given a surprisingly large and underexplored nongenetic influence 6 . this nongenetic influence includes meaningful and predictable variation from factors such as seasonal or diurnal rhythms 6 . in addition, there are profound social influences on testosterone that are sometimes more clear than the more widely studied effects of hormones on behavior 7 9 ."
Attack,being stigmatized and scorned for unacceptable opinions is the whole point of political correctness.,"pc scorns people for expressing bad beliefs, but not for having them, or even acting in accordance with them."
Attack,individuals who already have access to good quality healthcare should not have to give it up for a system that will be worse for them.,"under a two tier healthcare system , the government will provide basic care while individuals can still choose to privately pay for better care."
Support,many religious institutions are corrupt and exploit the vulnerable for financial gain .,the catholic church is known for its dubious financial conduct.
Support,the zionist philosophy is not shared by all jewish people.,"orthodox jews believe that zionism is heretical and sacrilegious , contending that the hastening of the return to eretz israel should be guided by divine, not human, will."
Support,policing and enforcing anti fake news laws could threaten privacy rights.,fake news frequently spreads through private online conversations .
Attack,historians and people who are passionate about learning extinct languages would keep the old languages alive.,attempts to resurrect near extinct languages as living languages typically fail without significant motive beyond antiquarian interest and even then do not resurrect them as they once were.
Support,"jeduthun has six sons, but the list of sons only includes five names 1 chronicles 25:3 because of a copyist error where shimei was accidentally omitted at some point.",some manuscripts include shimei in the list of names footnote a .
Attack,"with uniforms, students don't have to worry about what to wear everyday.",students still have to worry about whether their uniforms are clean or ironed.
Attack,"the fact that they only counted the houses of their followers, the rest relegated to assisted a number of nonbelievers as well , suggests that the number would have been quoted if it wasn't embarrassingly low.","with limited resources, any organization can only do so much."
Support,other individuals' poor lifestyle choices force healthy people to bear the costs.,"individual choices, like smoking, raise the risk of future illnesses and drive up healthcare expenses."
Support,"the government , especially the judicial branch, should be neutral and objective, rather than giving in to public opinion.","in 2020 , all major scotus decisions were in line with public opinion, indicating that it is in some way adherent to social expectations."
Attack,teleological argument for god s existence by dr. william ln. craig.,see 1.1.7.3.5.1.1.3.4.2.1.1.1.1.2.1.2.4.2.2.1.2.3.3.2.2.
Attack,nuclear powers have used nuclear weapons in the past.,nuclear weapons have not been used against other nuclear powers.
Attack,"if capitalism prioritized profit over well being, it would incentivize theft. since all countries that embrace capitalism also legislate against theft, capitalism does not incentivize theft, and therefore does not prioritize profit over well being.",wage theft is one of the biggest forms of theft and bears no legal consequence for employers.
Attack,if the citizens had a way of directly putting their concerns on the ballot perhaps with a certain number of signatures this would counterbalance the power of whatever institution normally decides what is voted on.,"the uk has a petition system which has enabled 59 topics to be debated in the house of commons, but none have ever resulted in a change of policy."
Attack,"though feminists suggest that there is a wage gap, its existence is disputed and is unlikely to have come from sexist origins.","factors such as role or hours are determined by societal or historical sexism, and continue to maintain or worsen the pay gap."
Attack,politicians alone are usually unable to inspire violence. it is when violent rhetoric is repeated by media and other prominent voices that incitement happens . simply censoring politicians will therefore have little effect.,censoring violent politicians is necessary. politicians who are excellent public speakers have been capable of radicalizing a nation through hateful and violent rhetoric without the existence of social media. adolf hitler exemplifies this case.
Attack,"the right to representation is triggered only when the state charges you in criminal court, therefore it exists with constraints unlike publicly provisioned health care.",access to health care by a public practitioner can also be placed within reasonable constraints.
Attack,irv incentivizes strategically voting for one frontrunner first and the other last.,"with irv, when your favorite candidate is not a frontrunner you lose nothing by voting for your preferred candidate before the frontrunner. duplicate claim kialo.com"

Attack,"humans do not recognize the idea of harming a few for the benefit of many as an acceptable justification for acts that harm other individuals. if it is not an acceptable excuse to hurt humans, it is not an acceptable excuse to hurt animals.",humans do not have a collectively agreed upon set of morals. that is why we have a vast range of religions and belief systems.

Support,life sentences are a sufficient deterrent of crime such that the death penalty is rendered unnecessary.,prisons in scandinavian countries are not harsh and have some of the lowest recidivism rates in the world.
Support,"one cannot use the scientific method to measure metaphysical ideas. using science to understand religion is like using chemistry to prove the meaning of art, or physics to prove the concept of love.","the experience of god is subjective, and as such falls outside the realm of hard science, much like the subjective experiences of art or beauty."
Attack,"students are segregated into remedial or advanced classes, so that teachers can more accurately meet their needs.","while more needs are met, this does not necessarily mean that conflict is avoided."

Support,"even assuming that vaccines are a good thing, fines are not the right way to encourage enforce this health practice.",enforcing vaccination will antagonize parents against governments and pharmaceutical companies and will lead to a more reduced amount of vaccinated children.
Support,the passage where job 9:6 appears is highly likely to be figurative.,"job 9:8 describes god walking on the sea, but this is probably not literal."
Attack,"given that polyandry is less common than polygyny across cultures, there would likely be far fewer available women than men if polygamy were to be allowed.","today, without polygamy there are many people who do not have a partner, so the problem is not a general supply side problem."

Support,boys may be less likely to act out of order in an attempt to impress girls when they are in a single sex environment.,"experiments have found that men behave more prosocially in the presence of women, especially attractive women. therefore, there is good reason to believe that boys will be better behaved in mixed sex environments."
Support,it is uncertain weather those higher laws even truly exist.,"in a democracy there can't be a higher law than a government that has been chosen by its citizens, otherwise it would become a dictatorship ."
Attack,"a proper morality is something that arises from a human individual's natural function. success at fulfilling one's natural function is one's natural good or well being , and this forms the standard of evaluation of virtues and values. if you are a human being, then this objective morality of fulfilling your natural function applies to you.","natural is a very flexible and undefined term, and can be used to describe almost anything."
Attack,"any casualties suffered by the eu army would be highly politicised, with anti eu campaigners claiming them as symbols of why member states should leave.","nato forces have already faced significant casualties in afghanistan and elsewhere without calls for abandonment of nato, even when most recent military interventions have been 'american' rather than european conflicts. it is unclear why a similar logic would not apply to eu army casualties."
Attack,"religion concerns topics not covered in history, so it cannot be taught comprehensively in a history class.",schoolchildren do not need to have a comprehensive and entirely thorough religious education. learning about the basics is enough.
Attack,"the us maintains a military presence in the middle east in support of israel, but this presence often provokes resentment from regional groups that choose to retaliate with aggression.","in the absence of a us military presence in the region as a deterrent, these groups might have been prone to launching aggressive attacks against israel and each other."

Support,"a genderless society would involve the suppression of some of the most instinctive aspects of humanity and, thus, require extreme government overreach.",a genderless society may lead to the stigmatization or criminalisation of those who adopt a gender identity.
Attack,survivors of sexual assault suffering from post traumatic stress disorder ptsd may seek spaces that are free from male bodies to avoid assault related triggers .,"given that every incidence of violence is different, accounting for everyone's triggers is impossible."
Attack,"humans, as apex predators who have usurped the predatory apexes of the other predators in the ecosystems we have come to also inhabit, have an ethical responsibility to keep those ecosystems in check so that, eg, rampant deer populations do not cause deforestation and subsequent ecosystem collapse. even where there are populations of healthy apex predators, these populations should also be checked so they do not cause problems and kill people and it would be unethical to waste that meat.","we have already warped the ecosystem through domestication and selective breeding. we can put effort into reinstating these animals' natural habits, as animal experts sometimes do with orphaned or injured animals, and have had success with."
Attack,"overweight and obese people are at no greater risk of developing dying from heart disease or cancer than normal weight people, as long as they are metabolically fit.",there are many other serious health risks for obese individuals that threaten their quality of life. these should also be taken into consideration.
Support,putin claims that donbass has been facing a genocide perpetrated by the kiev regime.,"russia's investigative committee opened a criminal case over mass graves of over 300 civilians on the territory of the donetsk and lugansk people's republics, who according to the russian ambassador to the usa were killed only because they considered russian as their native language ."

Support,"full employment under existing communism was usually achieved by forcing people to work in undesirable jobs including low payment, bad working conditions and draconic penalties in case of absences or late arrivals.","slavery solves unemployment, but its problem is worse than that which it solves."
Attack,moral relativism allows for more diverse rationales for morality and is often preferred over moral objectivism.,"moral relativism results in irrational conclusions since it requires that different, opposed moral values be considered equally valid."
Attack,the bahá'í faith has become increasingly fundamentalist ; many bahá'ís support the long term goal of establishing theocracy.,the literature discussing the theocratic goals of the baha'i faith has been written by non baha'is and suffers from an incomplete understanding of the faith's principles p. 1 .
Attack,"data on mass shootings may be misleading, since some definitions of mass shooting have been expanded to include incidents involving small groups of people and the use of pellet guns .",the two pellet gun incidents included in the original calculation have been dubbed a glitch and removed from the data.
Attack,"there are more effective ways to communicate to the public such as by writing open letters , protests, and or publicity stunts for example.","if one takes the example of open letters, most such open letters did not get any proper media coverage at all and if they did, it was only low coverage with little publicity."
Attack,some animals' behavior shows they are aware of what actions humans and other non human animals take and how it might effect their chances of survival.,"they may be especially aware of things that impact their survival, yet they are still fallible and limited. they can be wrong. if this wasn't the case, animals would never be killed by other animals. similarly, there may be cases where they think something benefits their survival when it actually doesn't."
Support,childbirth is a risk for anyone. people with health issues that preclude them from being able to give birth safely need a legal alternative to carrying a pregnancy to term.,"legalised abortion has had a great impact on reducing maternal mortality, as seen in romania after the liberalization of abortion p. 20 ."

Support,the blind man healed by jesus near jericho referred to in mark 10:46 52 and luke 18:35 43 is different compared to the two blind men mentioned in matthew 20:30 34 .,blindness would have been prevalent enough that jesus could reasonably have encountered four blind men in jericho.

Attack,accpeting polygamy as legal form of marriage could lead to financial losses for fiscal authorities.,fiscal authorities do not have to take care of separate files but can group more people together and thus save time when working on it.
Attack,"to say that perception is clouded by subjective evaluation suggests that the object of perception nonetheless exists objectively, above the clouds of subjectivity .","its existence is not empirically provable due to subjective bias. to suggest it exists, the burden of proof lies on the proposal, not the counter."
Attack,life without parole can also make sure that a convicted criminal does not ever offend again.,many criminals who are only incarcerated continue to arrange and indirectly commit crimes through associates on the outside.
Support,open source ai means the ai will be more equitable and accessible since the costs will be lower.,many people only have low financial resources. ais will not be accessible to them if costs aren't low which they can be if they can e.g. run the model locally on their own machine or on a web platform that makes the foss model available.

Attack,"nuclear energy is usually powered by uranium, a nonrenewable source of energy, which is inherently unsustainable.",some nuclear reactors are considered renewable sources of energy as they produce more fuel than they consume.
Support,"this is mis use of the term 'emotive conjugation ' aka russel conjugation . emotive conjugation is a rhetorical tool and has no bearing on the actual status of bravery, nor recklessness, as being virtuous.",an example of emotive conjugation would be a reckless person misleadingly describing their own reckless actions as being examples of bravery. to describe it as such does not make that reckless behaviour actual bravery nor virtuous.
Attack,companies whose employees feel more highly valued relative to the ceo are likely to work harder and be more productive.,people who work for companies run by ultra wealthy individuals still report high levels of job satisfaction.

Support,straight people tend to behave badly in gay bars which deters lgbtq patrons from those places and harms the community.,straight patrons can make drag performers uncomfortable by manhandling and making uncomfortable disclosures to them.
Attack,"the assumption that ultimate suffering is inherently evil presumes omniscience from the person defining what is and isn't evil as well as all potential future outcomes. because suffering exists, does not preclude that suffering is inherently evil.","if defining good and evil requires omniscience, then we would be unable to recognise god as being good, or at least attribute this quality to him. 'good' would lose all meaning and therefore the proposition 'god is all good' becomes nonsensical."
Support,"when we explore the life of amenhotep ii, a picture emerges which is quite consistent with what the bible states concerning this king and some of the momentous events which happened during his reign.","from what we know of egypt s pharaohs, inscribed on tombs, walls, and monuments, they didn t record military losses. it is highly unlikely that some future archaeologist is going to find an inscription where amenhotep ii touts that a foreign god i.e. yahweh of the jews made a mockery of the egyptian gods including the pharaoh who was himself considered a god , defeated his armies in the desert, and safely delivered an enslaved people to freedom."
Attack,"the fact that some people do not choose obesity doesn't mean we should accept those who do, and society is capable of distinguishing between those two groups.","whether or not someone has 'chosen' to be obese is often not clear cut, and when in doubt, society tends to condemn and shame."

Support,the research defence society believes that animal testing is 'morally and ethically justified .',"without animal research, there would be severe consequences for public health and medical research ."
Attack,free speech protects expressions that are considered controversial.,"the united states constitution protects freedom of speech in the public sphere only so long as the speech does not incite violence among the people. all monuments of the confederacy, be they statues of confederate leaders, or flags, are symbols that are inherently predicated on inciting violence, therefore they are not protected speech and should be removed from the public sphere."
Support,"this is bad, because it accomplishes little and instead makes the world worse off than before.","more resources are used to make up for what is lost. for example, another animal has to be raised for the meat that went spoiled."

Attack,lack of free market and competition in a communist system leads to slower scientific and technical innovations.,"scientific or technical innovations don't usually have a straight return of investment, or at least not an easy measurable one. therefore, free market will tend to prefer other investments over science. lack of free market, if anything, could even benefit scientific breakthroughs."
Support,existential threats come from space. exploring space helps humanity better understand and prepare.,exploring space helps locate dying stars that explode in supernovae and send destructive gamma rays toward earth.
Attack,not all israelis demand that palestine recognises israel as jewish.,"for many jews in israel , palestinian recognition of their state as the jewish homeland is far more important than a peace deal."
Support,lucian of samosata's work the passing of peregrinus provides evidence that the early christians worshipped jesus as god.,"paragraph 11 says, he inter preted and explained some of their books and even composed many, ... whom they still worship, the man who was crucified in palestine because he introduced this new cult into the world."
Attack,many public figures believe that chatgpt is dangerous.,"many of the concerns that these public figures have stem from the long term risks posed by future ai programs, not chatgpt itself."
Attack,"to an even greater degree, the irreligious do not agree on what standard of morality to adhere to. religion, at least, allows groups of people to agree on a moral standard.","there doesn't have to be a single, universal moral standard. assortative groups can follow their own local rules and customs and be 'moral' within their own terms of reference."

Attack,"diversity has significant positive implications for company profitability , encouraging both investment and innovation p. 5 .",innovation has been shown to paradoxically increase the gender pay gap p. 3 .
Support,"if intent to misdirect needs to be proven in court, there would be serious hurdles to abuse by government.",it's hard to prove intent to deceive and cause harm rather than simply being naive and uninformed.
Attack,research from uber indicates that the 7 pay gap between men and women within their contractor pool is caused by factors other than gender.,"uber and their app are both fundamentally biased and are, therefore, unreliable sources to carry out research into their gender pay gap."
Attack,"questioning science does not necessarily make elected public figures dangerous. in some cases, questioning science is reasonable and expected.","as politicians are usually not scientists themselves, they are not in a position to criticize the findings of the scientific community. this is why they use scientific advisors ."
Attack,"the death of an adult affects society more on a short term basis, but over the long term, the child has greater potential to contribute to society. thus, the indirect social impact is larger.",there is no assurance that the child will live up this hypothetical potential in the long term.
Support,"the problem of absent qualia is evidence against functionalism. according to functionalism, if unconscious machines like a robot are able to imitate consciousness by embodying the right functional state, then they are, in fact, in that mental state. this seems wrong. if a robot can be set up to grimace, shout ouch! and so forth after being stuck with a pin, the robot would still not be in the state of being in pain because the specific conscious property of painfulness would be absent.","the chinese room thought experiment demonstrates functionalism to be false. the chinese room with the person inside would simulate a computer to an outside person and represents a functionalist account of mental states like thinking and understanding meaning. for a person outside, the room receives input and gives output in a way that makes it appear that the room understands chinese. but all the room really does is imitate mental understanding. it does not possess it."
Support,tax evasion strategies and other loopholes are rampant among top companies in the u.s. this is made even worse by lobbying and special interest groups.,a wide range of hugely succesful companies have paid 0 in federal income tax.
Attack,"according to william ln. craig s moral argument for god s existence, if god does not exist, objective moral values and duties do not exist. since objective moral values and duties do exist, it follows that god has to exist as well.","the concept of an 'objective value' may be an oxymoron. values depend on opinions, else we are talking about facts."
Support,the crimean status referendum of 2014 produced a 97 vote for integration of the region into the russian federation with an 83 percent voter turnout.,there were foreign independent observers from many different countries who did not report any issues with the referendum.
Support,meat production leads to extensive conversion of tropical forests to new pastures.,animals have a low efficiency of converting feed to muscle which requires a lot of cropland.

Attack,"different religions disagree on many things, this does not change the truth of their claims.","religious exclusivism , the view that only the moral system advocated by a particular religion is valid, is a common feature of major world religions. this violates the principle of non contradiction , since all religions cannot claim to be the sole bearers of truth; which also leads to doubts regarding their other teachings."
Support,"jesus could have appeared to the disciples in spirit form, not as a physical body.","the earliest writings, including paul's epistles, do not mention jesus physically appearing to anyone. jashow.org"
Attack,the international criminal court is carrying out an investigation into suspected war crimes carried out by the us armed forces in afghanistan.,investigation of a crime does not mean it has happened.
Attack,"it is difficult to predict which existential risks will actually occur and which ones will not, so it could be wasteful to allocate resources towards addressing risks that may never materialize.","addressing actual happening issues can also help to build trust and support for addressing existential risks in the future, as people can see the positive impact of addressing current issues."
Support,online learning can increase the population's digital divide .,in the u.s. it is estimated that 1 in 10 of the poorest children has little or no access to technology for learning.
Support,"practically all of the remaining construction is work to either: build flood defences, repair existing walls, protect against environmental damage or fulfill the terms of existing contracts. these expenditures could all be seen as reasonable and not outside the scope of the intention of biden's promises.",officals from homeland security stated construction under the prior administration blew large holes into the rio grande valley s flood barrier system ... dhs will start work to quickly repair the flood barrier system to protect border communities. this work will not involve expanding the border barrier.
Attack,"ethically minded individuals deliberately choose to buy fair trade products for this reason and, as such, are likely to be more mindful in general of the many ways they can lessen their consumer impact on the world.","ethically minded individuals are more likely to participate in and support greenwashing pp. 227 228 . in general, they attempt to convince their own ego that they're lessening their carbon footprint when in reality, their very existence has a harmful impact on the planet."
Support,"all good does not imply all powerful. thus, even if evil did not exist, humans could still be distinct as less powerful creatures, and he would not lose his status as god.","if god is a maximally great being, than he possesses all great making properties in perfect form. by creating perfectly good creatures, god may still reserve other perfect attributes for himself, which he alone possesses like omnipotence."
Attack,"this requires many or at least some to participate which even in large projects often doesn't occur. example: lutris is a large foss project but only has one main developer and 10 devs who substantially contributed to the code. participation is often limited to mainly the issues bug reports, innovative ideas, and feature requests .",this could be changed if there were more rewards for contributing to useful or popular foss or for example if digital education made students contribute to existing foss projects for applied learning.
Support,public education for the masses is necessary to protect democracy from demagogue rule .,"in finland, critical thinking is part of the core curriculum, and students are taught how to identify fake news as early as primary school. other countries should follow this example."

Attack,"in south carolina's declaration of secession , the first sentence reads frequent violations of the constitution of the united states, by the federal government, and its encroachments upon the reserved rights of the states.","according to the declaration , the general government has ceased to effect the objects of the constitution due to increasing hostility on the part of the non slaveholding states to the institution of slavery ."
Support,"it is self defense to kill a vampire, and therefore moral to do so.","a vampire's purpose is to drink humans' blood, which can kill humans. since killing humans is considered morally wrong, it is not wrong to kill vampires."
Attack,increased empathy alone is unlikely to stop people from being rude to each other.,people are rarely rude for the sake of being rude. understanding others because one is empathetic can help to avoid such incidents occurring.
Support,this problem could be solved by using the death penalty and making reforms to execute convicts quicker.,many prisoners in the us have been waiting on death row for over 20 years . this wait should be reduced.
Attack,many other figures in the new testament identify jesus as the messiah.,"the new testament was written many years after the crucifixion, when jesus' followers had already begun to interpret him as the messiah. thus, they could easily have inserted claims that jesus was the messiah into the story even if those never actually happened in history."
Support,"though people may be born with the capacity for empathy, empathy is a learned behavior that needs to be developed over time using different tools and strategies .","empathy can only be honed with experience. as people gain more life experience , they are better equipped to process and rationalize a diverse range of perspectives."
Attack,men are credited with a higher number of humanity's greatest achievements .,men only achieved more because women were oppressed.
Attack,"while god did enter into the wager with satan, he did not plan or cause the afflictions which eventually harmed job. the haphazard way in which job's test occurred job 1:7 , does not seem like it was part of god's grand plan for the world.","the whole idea of a supreme deity's grand plan is that nothing is outside the borders of their grand plan. this means that the testing, and by extension the suffering, was intentional at worst, or allowed at best."
Support,on the contrary the rapid acceleration smooth power delivery of most ev s is more fun.,"ev's have faster and smoother acceleration, immediate throttle response, lower center of gravity, all without disturbing other people because of the silent motor."

Attack,the right to free speech is not more important than the right to life or liberty.,"even if freedom of speech is not a prerequisite for other rights, it can be derived as a necessary component of other rights."
Support,"agi would only be members of society in a limited sense, meaning that the legal status of agi should also be limited.","full membership in society requires full integration of its members. to the extent that agi remains different from human beings, its participation in human society will be limited."
Attack,fear of hell in religion is generally closely linked to a moral dogma that compels people to be the religion's version of good.,hell is part of the moral dogma since it is the punishment given to those who do not follow the dogma. in the case where the dogma instructs a despicable thing then the fear or hell will compel them to do it and there is no dogma that prevents it since the dogma is causing it.
Attack,"the bible states that david killed goliath with a slingshot, and simultaneously states that he was killed by a sword .","1 samuel 17:49 describes david hitting goliath with the sling. verse 51 mentions david cutting off goliath's head but doesn't say the sword killed him. instead, the beheading happened after he killed him, implying that goliath was killed by the sling, and then he was beheaded after his death."
Attack,"before enacting new, more effective gun control laws, the failures of current laws and regulations regarding firearms must be addressed.",the existing laws suffer from a number of notable gaps that can only be remedied via new legislation.
Support,agi should be developed and studied to advance science and knowledge.,efforts to create agi can provide insights that lead to a better understanding of the human brain.
Attack,"some bacterium floating through space on an asteroid will never be able to establish a society living on a foreign planet. no animal has the capacity for that either; only human beings. if there are ever to be civilizations spanning galaxies, they will exist only because of the human race.",evolutionary biologists generally agree that humans and other living species descended from bacteria like ancestors about two billion years ago.
Attack,"since god was his father, jesus was not descended on his father's side from king david genesis 49:10 and isaiah 11:1 .",jesus was descended from david on his mother's side; there is no good reason why this shouldn't count.
Attack,"it is misleading to think of a deity of the traditional monotheistic type that would submit to being tested for its existence by means of the sciences. hence, the observability of the activity of deities asserts only the existence of deities active in the observable world at the time of performing the test a highly inconclusive type of testing for a personal being . there are other fields of experience of human life that can provide reasonable justification for the existence of deities.",a deity which does not intervene in the physical world is indistinguishable from a deity which does not exist.
Support,"president trump held a 17th century , zero sum view of international trade, which was refuted by economists of all stripes.","president trump supported anti trade policies. such as tariffs , and opposed free trade deals, such as the tpp and nafta, while failing to recognize their zero sum nature."
Attack,"as the bible is a collection of numerous books, there are certain books that can be taken literally depending on the genre. indeed, many scholars treat these as historical documents whose facts can be explored and verified, thus affirming that many portions of the bible can be taken literally.","large portions of the bible previously taken as history have been demonstrated to be at best incredibly unlikely to have happened. an example is the exodus story which is now thought to never have happened. here is an introduction to the topic . over time less and less of the bible has been able to be taken literally, so though some small portions may hold some truth over all the narrative holds little to no credibility."
Support,that men should be punished or attacked is a view espoused by many leading feminists.,"probably the only place where a man can feel really secure is in a maximum security prison, except for the imminent threat of release. germaine greer"
Attack,"god is a fake explanation because it does not make predictions does not constrain anticipation. if your theory is equally good at explaining any outcome, then mathematically, necessarily, you have zero knowledge on the topic.","according to the author, constraining anticipation would mean something like, to force or compel the action of anticipating something. if arguments for god's existence compel us to think that god is the best explanation for certain things, then this could have profound implications for human lives. thus, god as explanation for some things does constrain anticipation."
Support,"taxpayer money could be distributed to health departments and used towards supporting adoption, both of which would only save lives, not end them.",subsidies have proven to be effective at increasing the number children adopted from foster care p. 11 .
Attack,"public school classrooms are mandated, sanctioned, and funded by the state. teachers do not have the right to violate this sanctity with their religious symbols.","limiting the ability to wear religious symbols violates basic human rights such as the freedom of religion and expression. not allowing the teachers to wear religious symbols may cause potential strikes and protests. even if wearing religious symbols is not allowed, there may be some schools that support certain religions such as presbyterian school, making it futile to ban these religious symbols"
Support,science and knowledge can be better advanced by studying fields other than agi.,agi research can be more costly and time consuming than research in other fields.

Attack,"if palestine is treated as a legitimate state then it is easier to hold to account, as the us can insist on free and fair elections and political accountability.","roadblocks such as republican support for israel, and president biden's new dovish disposition may limit the application of political pressure on palestine to act democratically."
Attack,"feminism also improves society for all genders, not just women.","feminism's goal is not to improve all of society, but specifically improve society for women. it is known as the women's movement, the feminist movement, women's liberation, female emancipation, women's rights; and informal, women's liberation. if it does improve for both genders, this is an accidental by product, not a motive, goal or aim of the movement itself."

Support,on a long distance journey after driving for 2 hours it is recommended to take a break. an ev driver can charge their car and take a break at the same time. a fossil fuel car will need to fill their tank and then take a break i.e. the fossil fuel car can take longer .,"an ev would refuel in much the same way a fossil fuel vehicle refuels. furthermore, recommended ergonomic breaks can occur concurrently with refueling, rendering moot any relevance they have with refueling timeframes."
Attack,markets have shown that they can provide consumers with more options than government run health care systems.,"studies evaluated in this systematic review do not support the claim that the private sector is usually more efficient, accountable, or medically effective than the public sector; however, the public sector appears frequently to lack timeliness and hospitality towards patients. basu, sanjay et al. 2012"

Support,failure in history does not mean that it is a failure in future.,knowledge always develops over time. many good ideas will fail before they can be refined and used.
Support,"if the etob hypothesis is true, it can then be inferred that there is a possibility that some etobs actively engage in keeping such evidence suppressed, for example by making use of stealth and camera disabling technologies or by retrieving evidence before publication. karla turner argued that based on e.g. the common use of 'missing time' memory blockades, alien activity is in its nature designed deliberately to prevent humans from having concrete evidence.","alien abductions could be done, at least in part, to motivate governments to keep it secret since otherwise the populace would be afraid and feel insecure and so on. cattle mutilations and e.g. deliberate crashes could for example be done to make it sound absurd and implausible."
Attack,"republics aren't a 'modern' concept either. both monarchy and republicanism have evolved from their ancient roots, adapting to fit modern values.","monarchy is outdated because its claim to legitimacy the divine right of kings has been universally rejected as implausible and incompatible with present day democratic values. republics may be old, but their claim to legitimacy, the consent of the governed, has been near universally embraced as recognized as the sole basis of governmental legitimacy."
Support,it could also be misconstrued as an unwillingness to cooperate toward peaceful reconciliation.,"as a result, nk might give up cooperation entirely and increase military provocations."
Support,"for example, one's hair length could be a symbol of their faith; a beaded necklace or simple thread of white cloth could also be considered religiously significant symbols.","a beard can be a religious symbol for christians, jews, muslims, and others. it is impossible to decide if wearing a beard is religious in principle."
Support,"as discussed in the same study, pregnancy intention is generally assessed after the fact, and is therefore subject to changes in perceptions of wantedness that are associated with different pregnancy outcomes p. 8 .",recent mothers may be more likely to perceive their pregnancy as intentional after the child is born p. 249 .
Support,"the state often fails to provide parents with the infrastructure required to be good, responsible parents.","poor minimum wage laws mean that parents often have to work multiple jobs, reducing the amount of time and care they can give their kids."
Support,"as feminism discriminates between groups it attempts to help, it must draw attention to sexism continually to justify its existence. other groups do not have this issue.","an egalitarian approach may be more useful than a feminist one, as it does not immediately discern between the groups it attempts to help. this approach ensures that incendiary stances are less viable, as there is an emphasis on coalition building."
Attack,"following every major worldwide nuclear incident, more international protocols were established to prevent future disasters.","more unexpected situations are bound to occur, especially as extreme weather events are projected to continue substantially increasing in both frequency and destructive potential."
Support,multiple threats could take the top spot as being equally most pressing.,"the bulletin of the atomic scientists on their doomsday clock thematize multiple top global existential threats without specifying or clarifying which of these would take the top spot, possibly partly because these are concurrent potentially synergistic issues: nuclear risk, climate change, biological risk, disruptive technologies."

Attack,having children is a way of supporting the economical pillars of many developed countries around the world that have a substantial shortage of workers.,"the economies of many developed countries seek workers in industries that are highly suboptimal in terms of efficiency and or are relatively harmful to people, especially future generations. examples of such may include the car industry or tourism air travel . concerning such industries, there are calls to inhibit and downscale their economic activities."
Attack,the idea of a meatless diet being weak or deficient in protein is not accurate as we know some of the strongest animals on earth are vegetarian.,"the human metabolism is much different from that of elephants, gorillas, and cattle. these animals spend a majority of their time eating and their stomachs are designed to process hard to digest plant matter. humans are not designed to eat purely plants in the same way and therefore cannot subsist on the same diet and expect the same results."

Support,there may be good reasons for why this could be an exception where such is possible such as the unprecedented nature of this subject or because of unique characteristics such as unique risks that all or nearly all people in possession of such evidence consider to be true or likely.,"contemporary societies and human civilization may not be considered ready to manage e.g. open tasks, complications, etc, such as living with the knowledge of more powerful often undetectable beings and or subjects comparable to land rights, all complicated by e.g. that there could be a very large number of different species subgroups. if their presence remains unacknowledged, the resolutions or thematization of such may get delayed to when collective intelligence culture are more mature."
Support,"johnson's quick resolution, or even complete jettison, of elements introduced by his predecessor smacks of design by committee a pejorative for a project with multiple designers but no unifying plan or vision .","the absence of a preconcerted road map for the trilogy among its various writers 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 enabled johnson to make carte blanche decisions when it came to seemingly important plot threads."
Support,hate speech is performative and often has illocutionary force .,"whereas 'locutionary acts' merely seek to convey information to a listener, hate speech often carries 'force ' in that it tries to urge listeners to adopt certain feelings and opinions."

Support,"creating an intelligent artificial workforce has the potential to eliminate the need for exploitative low income jobs, which could reduce the demand for modern forced laborers and human trafficking.","artificial workers could replace human beings in dangerous and tedious jobs, thus reducing unnecessary risks of work related injury and creating opportunities to seek more fulfilling work."
Support,morality can be based on rationality and reason without recourse to foundational concepts like gods or scriptures.,"morality is a social construct those changes with the times. religious morality was used as justification for slavery , for example."
Support,however people can be deceived or fool themselves.,it may be something other than meditation that is causing people to feel better; people are generally unable to distinguish correlation from causation.
Attack,contemporary societies frown upon people who do not fit within one of the binary gender categories. people who adopt traits from other genders are viewed as contrarians and often ridiculed.,"a genderless society would eliminate the element of choice that is created by the existence of gender categories. for example, there would no longer be men's clothes and women's clothes."
Attack,geoengineering is likely to reverse the impacts of climate change.,there is no current evidence that geoengineering can 'reverse' impacts. even using solar geoengineering as an assist to meet current climate goals looks to require investment and commitment significantly beyond anything that is currently planned or plausible.
Attack,"meat does not help build muscle mass, instead, specific exercise regimes build muscle mass in conjunction with a suitable protein and energy intake.",meat does help build muscle mass since it is high in saturated fats which are optimum for muscle growth.
Support,"the possibility that jesus is god or that he rose from the dead are not capable of being explored by science, and thus don't contradict science.","if jesus is god, he could prevent a scientifically plausible explanation for his resurrection from the dead to exist be discovered."

Attack,"under capitalism, jobs that don't produce capital such as artistic jobs which are essential for our culture and spirituality are already underpaid, as well as very important, life saving jobs such as doctors.","intellectual property such as copyrights are a form of capital, so saying artistic jobs don't produce capital is flatly wrong."

Support,"changeability, forkability, open re use and configureability allow people to set the ai up with unaligned values. for example, social media algorithms could censor specified decent posts while boosting malicious ones and fundamentalist chatbot like systems could make recommendations based on popular religious texts.","an ai model could be more easily customized and adjusted to censor certain information or be un biased in certain ways that could be considered problematic. that may not be possible, or not as easily possible, with proprietary ais by companies."

Attack,"just because we live in a universe in which its possible for us to live, doesn't mean that it was made for us. it just means that life can exist at this spot in a universe with these natural laws.",the above claim does not suggest that the universe was made for us exclusively. it simply states that an intelligent mind was responsible for its creation.

Attack,"in the ten commandments , god tells people not to kill. it is hence hypocritical for god to kill job's children to make a point.","the commandment actually refers to a prohibition on murder . if god could justify his killing of job's children as a result of a net benefit to the world, or because they were sinful, then it would not be fair to call what god did murder."

Attack,"it will separate the rich from the poor even more. the technology required for such a transaction of human mind will most probably be quite costly, and will make the now immortal rich stand out from the poor a lot more.",technologies often fall in price over time. this technology is likely to be the same.

Support,"the search for evidence to support a theory is prone to confirmation bias. if an entire field is biased toward naturalism to an extent that it blinds itself, it will filter evidence, data, and studies selectively, with a more philosophical approach than a scientific one. biased studies citing biased studies create compound error, and any objection invites dismissal.",there is ample proof that confirmation bias is a very human flaw in our search for knowledge.
Support,female circumcision is considered genital mutilation. male circumcision is no different.,there is lots of shared motivation: the cultural and religious background involves beliefs of cleanliness and health benefits for both practices.
Attack,"right or wrong, the functioning of our system of government relies on complying to the law that is passed. disputes with the law are made through the political process.","laws are also challenged through adjudications. to do so, the law may need to be violated e.g. minoru yasui breaking curfew . in this way, violating the law is not necessarily a problem."
Support,"the focus should be on reducing hate against minority groups, rather than pushing minority groups to feel that they must defend themselves because no one else will.",the focus should be put on education and awareness to reduce hate against minority groups . self defense would only perpetuate the idea that hate can only be fought with violence.
Support,there are many indications that evidence oversight suppression is occurring.,"nuccetelli testified that after one incident at vandenberg air force base, a witness to the close encounter was threatened by their superiors to stay quiet."
Support,internalized gender norms and expectations limit self expression by establishing prescriptive ideals of what it means to belong to a certain gender.,gender directly limits the choices that parents have when they pick a name for their child. this creates expectations for the child before they can even act freely.
Attack,"when engaging in any multicultural activity, one has to partake in that culture. this is not appropriation but simply engagement.","the way america engages in mexican culture does not actually address the culture itself, only america's harmful perceptions of it and its people."
Attack,the creation of a global police force would make it much easier to catch terrorists and violent criminals.,the creation of a one world state would not necessarily lead to the creation of a global police force.
Attack,the eu has not been responsible for the damage caused by the earthquake in syria or turkey.,earthquakes are becoming more frequent because of climate change; europe has contributed to that problem immensely.
Support,scientology is a complete and well established system of belief.,some of the most famous and influential people in the world are scientologists.
Attack,"the second law of thermodynamics indicates that, given enough time, the universe will inevitably stagnate in a state of heat death. if the universe existed from eternity past, it should already be in a state of heat death.",there are good reasons to think that the eventual heat death of the universe would cause another big bang .
Support,welfare is more reliable than the negative income tax.,welfare has multiple sources of financing beyond income.
Support,"in some cultures, conforming by participating in an arranged marriage, brings the couple greater social acceptance.","gaining acceptance via conforming to social norms such as arranged marriage is an almost universal human aspiration, since those who do not conform face negative social sanctions ."
Support,knowledge in stem subjects can help people develop pharmaceutical solutions.,pharamceutical companies are keen to promote stem education amongst young people with the hope that they will contribute toward the field in the future.
Attack,the only reason wikipedia exists today is because of its slow growth. to hand twitter off to a nfp now could be a failure with the sudden financial burden the organization would face.,"a handover could be gradual, taking several years."
Attack,"most or many varieties of religious naturalism such as pantheism or many of their advocates believers often use the word god to refer to concepts in cosmological ideas such as that it refers to an unknown creative process within the universe , or totality of the universe or monad .","as originally conceived by the pythagoreans, the monad is the supreme being, divinity or the totality of all things and spinoza who shaped monism has been described as a pantheist or monism as a largely pantheistic concept. the word god is not the right term for such concepts, hypotheses and or models."
Attack,"climate change policies are often inconvenient in the short term for voters. as politicians can be guided by votes, they need to be assured that they will not lose support for pursuing environmental policies.",climate change policies can appeal to short term voters experiencing adverse effects of climate change.
Attack,technologies exploit resources; they do not create them. exploiting more resources with greater efficiency does not change the fact that many of those resources are limited.,technological innovation that allows the recycling of resources in short supply could solve the problem of replenishing finite supplies.
Support,forbidding euthanasia by law implies the state's ownership claim of peoples' lives which in turn implies slavery.,the right to life is universally recognized as an inherent human right.
Attack,popular opinion seems to suggest that female leaders are handling the pandemic better.,one event in world history can not be conflated to mean women are better leaders overall.
Support,us healthcare remains among the most expensive in the world.,this cripples many lower and middle class families who cannot afford healthcare.
Attack,"in many cases, there is no obvious right or wrong in political decision making.",decisions based on values that are society oriented with the greater good in mind are better for society than decisions based on individual interests.
Support,"cannabis is widely available and regularly consumed in the eu, so legalization likely wouldn't increase exposure to its health risks among the general population.",legislation will reduce the risks by regulating the supply chain and enabling users to be properly educated about risk minimization.
Attack,"but in essence, politics always revolves around an analysis of the current state of the world, a comparison of what could be the world and a call to action to realize what is seen as a better world. to this end, science can be used as a means to convince others in any of these three categories but it is not political because of that.","if you are using science to convince people of your worldview, that is politics."
Support,this becomes less of an issue with more candidates. voters can safely vote for third parties in asset.,it can be immune to spoilers if enough candidates run and their positions match that of the voters.
Attack,"producing meat heavily contributes to climate change. eating meat does not contribute to climate change. even if it is true that humans should stop producing meat, it does not follow that humans should stop eating meat eg. from a hunted wild animal .","deflecting the climate change argument to argue for personally hunted meat only shifts the argument to the ethics of killing an animal for food, and attempts to detract from the very real environmental consequences of producing meat at a large scale."
Attack,"the cost of providing accommodations adjustments to employees with mental illness act as an extra financial burden on employers, so they may not hire them.",the costs for providing accommodations adjustments are fairly inexpensive.
Attack,"it is rare for humans to desire to kill animals, and their physiology suggests they are not designed to do so .",there is evidence that humans have innate hunting traits and possess a natural hunting instinct.
Attack,"nuclear non proliferation requires multilateral cooperation between all nuclear powers. therefore, if any state pursues unilateral proliferation, all other states are ethically justified in following suit.",the non compliance of some parties to the non proliferation agreement creates a need for others to follow suit for their own security.
Attack,"all human suffering would be eliminated without humans. in this manner, the world would in fact be better, even if only in the eyes of the humans who lived prior to their extinction.","this claim operates under the assumption that the only way to evaluate being is along a pleasure pain axis . meaning and fulfillment exist outside of this dichotomy, which is neglected by this claim."
Support,chatgpt is more accessible in the west than in the developing world.,"chatgpt requires internet access, which is more limited in the developing world."
Attack,"people who really care about privacy would start using open source, non mainstream e2e encrypted messengers that cannot be forced to have front doors .",even these need central infrastructure on the net for storing messages before they could be deleted and those could be blocked on a country level or the entities that pay for them sued embargoed.
Support,"the eu retains influence on markets by setting high domestic standards, remaking global regulations in the process.","the brussels effect suggests that the bigger and richer a consumer market is, the more likely it is that companies from outside who are exporting into that market will comply with its standards."
Support,traditional islamic jurisprudence is not accepting of lgbtq people.,homosexuality is prohibited in islamic religious texts .
Attack,that poor people find it difficult to get marriage suggests that the state should grant even more benefits to individuals who are poor to relieve difficulty.,poor people are not failing to get married purely because of the financial costs of marriage itself. a large reason for them not getting married is the existence of social norms which suggest people should only get married if they and their partners have a steady job.
Attack,"in some cases, the state does interfere in how parents raise their children.",surely the state cannot interfere whenever they want the population to behave according to their specific moral code.
Attack,china does not have the military capacity to truly threaten europe.,china's military is rapidly developing and expanding and has already surpassed the capabilities of european's combined armed forces.
Support,"decentralization allows those who care to focus on what matters to them, rather than working together on a reform nobody likes, cares about, or feels is good enough to merit attention or effort.",more effort and success can be reaped from the passion of decentralization in the long run than from centralization.
Attack,some islamic nations have imposed discriminatory curfews on women p. 72 .,muslim men are tasked with the protection of women by the qur'an; curfews are intended to prevent women from being assaulted .
Attack,life requires a designer because it has specified complexity .,"the idea of specific complexity has been widely rejected by academics and is, therefore, not used by them."
Support,"the internet has become a public space, so it should be regulated.","the internet is basically a means of contact between people, and the safety of people should be protected regardless of how it is threatened."
Support,"muslims have been shown to be less productive than non muslims living in western societies. for example in australia, 43 of working age muslims are not part of the labor force, compared to 24 for the general population.",similar statistics can be found about the netherlands.
Support,"the education system should provide students with the complete spectrum of information and skills needed to become good, respectful, responsible citizens, to complement any skills and values taught by parents.",research suggests that life skills courses have a high return on investment for the state.
Attack,"moral obligation does not require a divine judge, as one can be morally obligated and judged via communal agreement.","if social norms determine what is evil and good, then it would be evil to be counter cultural, even in a society where the collective moral norms were analogous to that of nazi germany. likewise, it would be morally good to abide by the norms of the third reich."
Support,"god's creation is made up of two things: matter and mind. where there is form, there is evidence of mind. god's mind is not determined by anything other than god. only matter is subject to cause and effect and that only conditionally.",it is god's will that causes the raw stuff of matter to coalesce into form.
Attack,"just because a person is earning money while they sleep does not mean that they work less than a person on minimum wage. perhaps the wealthy do not need to work, but this does not mean that the wealthy do not work. on the contrary, looking at the richest men in the world , most of them inexplicably continue to work full time.","even if they work full time, the work of the wealthy is often easier to do and should therefore be paid less. for example, a nurse's job involves hard physical and mental work and involves great responsibility. however, a nurse earns much less than some millionaire investor, whose job does not involve as much exertion."
Support,experiencing corporal punishment might desensitise children to violence.,"the acceptability of violence particularly harms girls, as it raises the likelihood of them tolerating domestic violence in the future."
Support,the fact that societies legitimize and enforce gender roles through the use of labels does not mean that they created gender itself.,"societies often legitimize different natural facts about humans for political ends. for example, the sex positivity movement seeks to legitimize sexual behaviour precisely because such urges are natural."
Attack,"the development of morals, and laws has often lagged behind the development of advanced technology, to the detriment of society. humans should not build something as powerful as agi on such shaky ground.","although no one can ever grasp the whole impact of a new technology before it appears, it is possible for the specialists to make reasonable predictions and prepare guidelines."
Attack,concluding that anything will happen on the basis of history is unhelpful in the case of a fictional story that can go in any direction the writers choose.,the writers of star wars have always respected the internal metaphysical consistency of the universe they create within and informed that by the real world. to suggest that they would abandon that is to suggested they they would fail to understand the remit of being a screenwriter. such a claim would be obtuse to the point of irrelevance.
Attack,the issue of dangerous emissions is probably best dealt with proper environmental regulations. this problem will occur anyway even with a smaller population.,"although technological changes and regulations have kept some emissions in check, ozone and nitrogen dioxide have increased to unacceptable levels in the large cities. legislature alone is not sufficient."
Support,"homeschooling barely existed in the us until the 1980s, suggesting that it is far from a necessity or basic human right.","historically, education itself used to be reserved solely for the elite ; the vast majority of the population was never afforded the opportunity to become educated."
Attack,"the existence of evil can be reconciled with an all powerful, all knowing and all loving god. god would not want to remove evil if a greater good were only achievable with the existence of evil.","this claim argues that evil is compatible with god because evil is limited in scope. but if god was loving, all knowing, and powerful, even limited, finite evil would be an anathema."
Attack,there is no evidence that illegal immigration rates have reduced since president trump was sworn into office.,"from 2017 to 2019, there was an increase in the number of detentions at the borders ."
Support,the islamic rite of khitan circumcision is a religious cultural sign of belonging to the muslim community.,not being circumcised at birth or at an early age could cause social problems for the individual in a conservative muslim or jewish community or in some countries cultures even if they are not that conservative.
Attack,"the arranged marriage process involves external parties in the search for a partner, rather than just the two people entering into the marriage. this makes finding a suitable life partner easier and more likely.","the input of external parties puts pressure on prospective marital partners to satisfy multiple criteria and people in a short timeframe. this can encourage dishonesty, which increases the likelihood of two incompatible candidates marrying each other."
Attack,each generation of each culture has different standards by which it judges the morality of a given action. things that are acceptable in today's america would have been reprehensible to the pilgrims and vice versa.,moral relativism does not necessarily imply moral skepticism.
Support,"adaptation to new circumstances and opportunities is a hallmark of evolution, and thus nature in action. a changing diet that overcomes the physical adaptation to a previous diet is thus natural.","when italian wall lizards were introduced to a new environment in the 1970s, they changed their diet from one heavy in plants to one heavy in insects, and accordingly adapted their morphology over generations."
Attack,per your own source it is quoted that many flat earthers i meet are quite religious and not that many christians today are flat earthers,"many is not a specific number. i did not say most . most christians are not flat earthers. however, nearly all american and european flat earthers are christians, because it is based on the ancient hebrew cosmology described in scripture. to confirm this, google image search ane cosmology ancient near east or ancient hebrew cosmology , or biblical cosmology . alternatively, interview 100 flat earthers about the basis of their belief to get a percentage, and report back."
Attack,"the belief in the theory of a patriarchy that there is some cabal of men shaping society is ludicrous, and not to mention insulting to the great women in history who had a hand in shaping the modern world.",it is not insulting to women to simultaneously recognize the unusual women who have wielded power and simultaneously notice how uncommon it was.
Support,islam draws a distinction between the acceptability of gender affirming surgery for transgender and intersex individuals. this denies transgender people recognition and access to gender affirming care.,"modern islamic jurisprudence only recognizes and sanctions surgical intervention for intersex people, and only does so in order to fit them into a gender binary, which demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding of the gender spectrum p. 80 ."
Support,"baasha, the king of israel, reigned for 24 years 1 kings 15:33 and 1 kings 16:6, 8 makes it clear that he dies by the 26th year of asa's reign over judah. however, according to 2 chronicles 16:1 , baasha is still alive by the 36th year of asa's reign.",the fact that 2 chronicles 15:19 corroborates the number in 2 chronicles 16:1 makes this likely.
Support,gm crops are often modified in ways that can make them better for the environment than their unmodified counterparts.,farm animals can be genetically modified to cause less harm to the environment.
Support,allowing humans to change their behavior to protect the environment is preferable to wiping out humans.,"humanity has only caused more harm because it has been the most successful at survival. all unchecked, unchallenged species wreak havoc on their respective ecosystems as they compete for resources. a more relevant point would be to look at humanity's ability to adapt to a more sustainable way of life."
Attack,president trump's foreign policy achievements demonstrated that he was a good president.,"president trump seemed unwilling to stand up to, or take a stand against, foreign governments , even when they murdered american residents , such as in the case of jamal khashoggi ."
Attack,"in a socialist economy, government spending would be more focused on public services rather than services which are generally used for political power.","higher spendings on public services, means more money possible wasted."
Support,humans control resources that an ai could use for its own purposes.,"the idea of instrumental convergence has been proposed by many thinkers on this topic, perhaps most notably niklas boström's paperclip maximiser ."

Support,"abortion allows for selective human evolution for non disabled genes, which leads to a stronger species.","modern society has halted natural selection. scientific advances can keep most people alive and well long enough to breed, whatever their condition. it is now our responsibility to try to improve the future outcome of human evolution. david attenborough humans stopped natural selection."
Attack,allowing anyone who identifies as a woman into women only spaces would benefit both cis and trans women by improving their ability to work towards change in these spaces.,"women only spaces have traditionally focused on issues that affect cis women, and many women today would prefer to honor this tradition."
Attack,"if the intent of the empty tomb stories was to provide drama to the account, we would expect to see a detailed narrative of the resurrection itself jesus leaving the tomb accompanied by all sorts of miracles .",such a story would gain drama at the expense of credibility.
Support,"most people are cisgender , so delaying puberty universally is unjustified.",disrupting the lives of the vast majority of the world to alleviate the suffering of a few reduces total positive utility in the world and is thus unjustified.
Attack,removing the memorials does not equate to erasing history; better to ensure that all people are encouraged to participate in public life.,removing memorials because some are offended devolves to who does and does not have a right to be offended?
Support,"pedophiles tend to assume they will not be caught, largely because child sex abuse is often underreported.",many children are abused by someone they know. this may make them less likely to report the crime if they fear for their abuser's life p. 5 .
Support,"in the absence of irrational religious beliefs, individuals will need to seek logical explanations for events they do not understand.","without religious dogma, people may turn to science and rational thinking for logical explanations about the natural world."
Attack,an eu army would be economically beneficial for the eu.,"creating an eu army may undermine the union's stability which will, in turn, damage the eu's economic interests."
Attack,this translation either turns the beginning of genesis 1 into a massive run on sentence or turns its first sentence into a sentence fragment of the form when x and y and z.,the verse divisions are much later than the original text and do not strictly divide the text into discrete sentences.
Support,"homogenization isn't a matter of good or bad, it is a matter of agreement or disagreement.","if people are freely choosing homogenization, then it should be considered a good thing, as freedom to choose how one lives is a fundamental right."

Support,zoos are a great source of enjoyment for many people.,"zoos are a tradition, and a visit to a zoo is a wholesome family activity ."
Support,"if someone is kind intentionally, one has reason to extrapolate that they will be or try to be kind in future circumstances. however, if they are kind due to accidental circumstances, we have no similar guarantee.","based on their actions , it is evident that the dalai lama is kind and thus would also be kind in the future."
Support,"if low skill workers are highly compensated, high skill employees may choose to quit and work in easier jobs for the same pay.","if the difference in pay is reduced, less people will be willing to commit to the increased hours, pressure and risk associated with working as a ceo."
Attack,"a pause in development, as suggested by hundreds of tech leaders and developers , could help governments worldwide establish relevant regulations and implement preventative measures.",government regulation of emerging technologies usually does more harm than good .
Support,coaches and clubs already coerce their athletes into taking peds. this would only get worse in a world where there were no consequences.,"without any kind of disincentive, the only incentive coaches and clubs have is to be as successful as possible, both in pursuit of success for its own sake, and the financial benefits that come with it. thus, they are likely to promote ped use to those ends."
Attack,"continuous assessment could harm students' academic performance, which could lead to them feeling stressed, anxious, or inadequate p. 18 .","continuous assessments are likely to paint a more well rounded and flattering picture of students' abilities as compared with traditional assessments, because they are conducted by teachers over longer periods of time and in more realistic circumstances."
Support,surveillance balloons may be a better tool for long term surveillance of a wide region.,"surveillance balloons can spend more time over a given area, because they move slower than satellites."
Support,making masks mandatory would limit access to masks by increasing demand and straining supply.,"if masks were mandatory, the shortage in supply would lead to profiteering and panic."
Attack,the variance of legislation from state to state and the confusion associated with poorly worded state laws be addressed by enacting strict federal gun control legislation pp. 2 4 .,the preemption of local and state gun laws by federal regulations inhibits the ability of local governments to develop and implement targeted new strategies for gun control .
Support,"radiocarbon dates are generally presented with a range of one standard deviation usually represented by the greek letter sigma as 1σ on either side of the mean. however, a date range of 1σ represents only 68 confidence level, so the true age of the object being measured may lie outside the range of dates quoted.","this was demonstrated by an experiment run by the british museum radiocarbon laboratory, in which weekly measurements were taken on the same sample for six months. the results varied widely though consistently with a normal distribution of errors in the measurements , and included multiple date ranges of 1σ confidence that did not overlap with each other. the measurements included one with a range from about 4250 to about 4390 years ago, and another with a range from about 4520 to about 4690."
Support,"even if these protein sources are complete, these options are relatively limited compared to the broader spectrum of animal based complete proteins that are more available and cheaper.","hemp seeds are among the smallest nuts in the world, which is why they are usually more expensive than other types of nuts."

Attack,heroes need to overcome personal challenges to become heroes. luke avoids conflict and projects himself still avoiding conflict and then dies.,"a conflict in a history is not only a physical combat, but an obstacle for the balance of the character wants and needs . the same way that luke become a jedi in rotj by throwing off his lightsaber and refusing to kill his own father against obi wan's advice and the emperor's plans , he deciding to trick kylo ren in letting the resistance escape showed he was wiser, and still commited to a non violent approach to conflicts. it fitted and respected the characters essence."

Attack,"even some signatories, here gary marcus , pointed out that ai risk agi risk and that we need to stop worrying just about skynet and robots taking over the world, and think a lot more about what criminals, including terrorists, might do with llms, and what, if anything, we might do to stop them .","that a signatory to the statement believes we should also worry about non existential ai risks is, if anything, an argument that the statement is not inappropriate or a distraction."
Support,"using ai in education will lead to education becoming a product, which will funnel funds out of schools to a few corporations.","the companies that create ai solutions will continue to influence learning, if not directly, then certainly indirectly. this means increased corporate influence in learning."

Attack,"insofar as religion is concerned, the pope does not have the authority to countermand the will of god on the subject. specifically, leviticus 18:22 says that engaging in homosexuality is a sin, therefore the pope can not say otherwise.","the bible also states many things that are not applied in modern life as they are accepted as outdated. the church's commitment to leviticus 18:22 is emblematic of prejudice, not god's will."
Support,laptop users could be placed in a seperate section of the classroom.,"the authors of one study restricted laptop use to one side of the classroom. in a survey, students attitudes towards this zoning policy improved after experiencing it in action; the majority supported it aguilar roca et al., p. 1305 ."
Support,"as those who wish to procreate will know how much their household must earn in order to be granted a license, they will aim for and save up accordingly.","there are various ways to offset the costs of adoption, including local government subsidies, adoption tax credits in the us , loans, and crowdfunding. similar avenues could be explored to cover the expense of parental licenses."
Attack,"if an infant has tonsils or an appendix removed then by the logic of this claim, that is similarly criminal violence because it would not have the consent of the infant.",medically necessary surgeries are not on the same level as cosmetic ones. it's the same reason a doctor can perform emergency procedures without you signing paperwork prior.
Support,"the chronicles of narnia are somewhat based on bibilical ideas, and as such are more of a narrative for christians than a fantasy story for all.","in a 1961 letter written by the author, c.s. lewis, he admits that each of the chronicles may depict a different christian story or theme."
Attack,"naively, criticism of the work being done by experts in a field would be expected to decrease funding, and those same experts would be unlikely to voice concerns.","they do not criticize work being done. moreover, it did not decrease but rather increase funding, partly fueled by hype that overstates ai potentials."
Attack,nearly every other important member of the early church is mentioned by name in acts.,nearly every other shows that the author of acts was not attempting to detail all of the events of all the apostles. instead was more focused on detailing paul's conversion and his proclamation of the good news to the greater roman empire.
Support,some marvel characters are imitations of dc characters.,"deadpool was originally meant to be an evil spider man, but then became inspired by deathstroke ."
Attack,"if gender is understood to be relative, it would not be up to an individual to determine their own gender identity. rather, it would then only be able to be determined by comparing it to other people's.","the author of the cited article conflates gender with gender identity : while society compares individuals to determine where they lie on a gender spectrum, individuals independently self identify where they belong within the spectrum."
Support,defunding planned parenthood would cost the us taxpayers an extra 77 million in order to cover the future care expenses incurred by unintended pregnancies.,"each unintended pregnancy costs taxpayers about 4800 p. 4 . since planned parenthood prevents an estimated 579,000 pregnancies annually saving over 2.7 billion , its 528 million in federal funding is comparitively nominal."
Support,any women only space that is intended to function as a wgss women and girls safe space must include security guards specifically hired to ensure the safety of both patrons and employees p. 218 .,"security staff can enforce rules, de escalate tense or potentially violent situations, remove disruptive or dangerous individuals, and contact law enforcement as needed."

Attack,"stopping meat production would come along with an increasing production of substitutes, such as vegetables, crops and fruits. this creates new livelihoods for farmers.","the animals currently used to farm meat will not disappear overnight. in order to immediately transition to agricultural farming, all of those animals would need to be slaughtered to make room for the vegetation. not only would this be cruel to the animals, but it would also destroy the farmers' finances."
Attack,"in the us, it is legal to use lethal force in self defense if one's life is threatened. gun control legislation limits an individual's capacity for self defense.","there are safer, cheaper, and more effective methods of self defense than using firearms."

Support,"individuals are better off acting in accordance with their own desires than subverting them to those of others, especially given the lack of agreement amongst and within religions on sexual morals.","as religions can be oppressive and cause social ills , it is not necessarily moral to adhere to them. given this, approaching strangers for sex publicly may be perfectly acceptable."
Support,inaccuracies within historical accounts are of common occurrence within the old testament.,"samuel committed suicide in 1 samuel 31:4 , but 2 samuel 1:10 claims that amalekite killed him, 2 samuel 21:12 says that the philistines struck him down at gilboa, and 1 chronicles 10:13 14 says that god killed him."
Support,publicly denouncing perpetrators of harm by finding them guilty in court is beneficial to victims and their families.,"it would be worth filing the lawsuit as an act of retribution; the ability to somehow fight back against the ultimate omniscient, omnipotent being is tempting to those who have been harmed in such a being's name."
Support,"there were 339 years between the flood and the tower of babel. it is reasonable that population growth would have been geographically close in proximity, and for one language to be become the most dominant over that same time period.",there are even more than 339 years between the flood and the tower of babel assuming an interpretation of genesis other than young earth creationism.
Attack,if students start later than they won t have as much time after school for sports and work.,sports and work can be conducted after sunset. the larger concern is that they keep children up late. allowing for a later school start means that children have a better chance to keep up with sports and study while also getting sufficient sleep.
Support,"a vampire's purpose is to drink humans' blood, which can kill humans. since killing humans is considered morally wrong, it is not wrong to kill vampires.","vampires sustain themselves very similarly to viruses; in order to live, something else has to become infected. thus, vampires can be equal in morality to killing a virus."
Attack,pope francis has not changed the church's doctrine on lgbtq issues.,"insofar as religion is concerned, the pope does not have the authority to countermand the will of god on the subject. specifically, leviticus 18:22 says that engaging in homosexuality is a sin, therefore the pope can not say otherwise."
Attack,"there is a general trend of people holding gradually more coherent beliefs over time, which suggests that discovering evidence leads us to update our beliefs.","while there is a general trend toward coherence in psychology, the psychological concept of coherence refers to how we emotionally and cognitively integrate with circumstances, rather than how raw evidence persuades us."

Attack,gun violence is an epidemic in american public schools; homeschooled students are generally safe from this kind of gun violence.,children are far more likely to become the victim of an accidental shooting at home than they are at risk of a mass shooting at school.
Support,the use of laptops is an integral and often essential part of education today. changing this would be regressive.,"during the covid 19 pandemic, governments pushed to digitize classrooms . this helped students continue with ther education during the crisis."
Attack,objectivity is inaccessible to humans. we must accept that all statements of truth are subjective.,"this is itself an objective claim, a circular argument."
Attack,"there are many reasonable circumstances in which it is acceptable to deliberately ignore someone's right to life. therefore, there is no absolute right to life, only a conditional right which depends on the circumstances.","in every scenario where it is acceptable to deliberately ignore someone's right to life, one only does so to directly ensure someone else's right to life. the death penalty does not adhere to this criterium."
Attack,the inclusion of strong adolescent characters allow for adolescents to enjoy engaging with reading and literary analysis.,"the ability to see things from unique or different perspectives is a large part of the appeal of reading. if adolescents only read books that cater exactly to them, then they miss out on this."

Attack,ubi is most beneficial to individuals below the poverty line. some of these individuals are below the poverty line because of addictions. the ubi would enable addictive behavior.,"it may be worth inadvertently enabling some addictive behaviour in order to deliver the other benefits of the ubi, such as assisting those in poverty for other reasons."
Attack,"it is immoral to bring creatures into existence in order to use and kill them. for example, it would be immoral to give birth to new children and use them as slaves or food.","this is because humans have special, higher order rights for example, a right to freedom. animals do not have these rights, so it is permissible to breed them for certain uses."
Support,"private charities can work quickly, and have been better able to handle critical research and crises than government, particularly during the covid 19 pandemic .",perhaps the best attributes of each could co operate for the public benefit. government could contract with charities so that they would not have to expend efforts and resources on fundraising and could concentrate on beneficence.

Support,president trump has a long history of offensive and sexist statements against women .,"i think the only difference between me and the other candidates is that i m more honest and my women are more beautiful. firstly, the 'honesty' is disputable, and secondly, women are not objects as suggested in this quote."
Attack,prayer is just a mechanism to get you invested in the religion.,"for christian latter day saints, prayer manifests faith in christ , as it is the substance of hope and leads to happiness."
Attack,"a person's morality develops from a set of external rulesets, ethics, under the direction of one's ego. whether the ego conforms or rejects an ethic is dependent on one's personal situation and experience. because the human ego is ultimately self serving, whatever serves the self may change for any reason or no reason. this is the very definition of subjectivism.",morality is linked to an individual's ability to empathize the ability to cognitively and emotionally relate to another's experience as if it were our own.

Support,"this assumes that people would get hired based on performance. however, this is often an arbitrary metric to go by.",nepotism is another method that has been used to hire people.
Support,"this imagination allows humans to discern present truths from universal truths. any attempt to uncover and enshrine universal truths over present truths would be a de facto value system, giving rise to a morality based on objective, or universal truths.","murdering is wrong by contradiction of what it means to have agency. since murder denies one party of being an agent, if you applied the same lack of agency to the murderer, the act of murder couldn't happen."

Support,"transformative ai is very near, which makes action on ai urgent.","a survey of experts in 2022 found an aggregate forecast time of 36.6 years ; this is already close enough to be scary, but in terms of ai progress 3 years ago is ages."
Attack,in a situation where there are a large number of candidates and most voters are bullet voting the non bullet voting voters have ballot power equal to approximately number of viable candidates 2 relative to the bullet voters. voters will be quickly trained against bullet voting.,voters will tend to bullet vote when they care more that their favorite win than care that their least approved loses.

Support,"finn rose's subplot exists to change finn from a character wanting to run and have no part of the war into a hero willing to sacrifice his life for a cause. rose represents the argument of taking action, while dj shows the negatives of looking out for yourself.","when rose appears, he is trying to run, then she shows him what true commitment looks like, and what a deep meaning to one's action is: finn just wants to get away and doesn't know why, but rose wants to fight because that's the way to make things better for the people she loves."
Attack,"if feminism aimed to meaningfully advance gender equality, it would demand that women be treated equally in situations where they currently are advantaged.","in comparison to men, women do not experience meaningful social advantages, as even benevolent sexism is still sexism. pushing for feminists to dismantle spaces of only surface level advantage is a waste of their resources."
Attack,very few communities would be able to band together as it requires a large number of homeschooling families in a small area with few non conforming families.,after school homeschooling environments are common around the world and could be an easy way for parents to hide supplemental learning from authorities.

Support,"the act of being elected does not afford an individual undue privileges if they break the terms of service of an internet platform, that platform has a right to remove that individual.","facebook's terms and conditions pt. 2 clearly state that users are not allowed to use their platform to post unlawful, misleading, discriminatory, or fraudulent content. if a user, including a politician, does so, facebook is entitled to remove them."
Support,empirical tools are not necessarily capable of proving or disproving the existence of free will.,"it is misleading to claim that there is a strong case for a deterministic universe without free will, given that the nature of consciousness remains a mystery today."
Support,story lines and characters set up in previous films were not treated with much respect.,the movie's subversion of established plot lines and characters led to an unnecessary split in the fan base among those who like this approach and those who don't.
Support,"if the democrats were indeed committing voter fraud, then a win in every conceivable race would make this very obvious, and so winning only the presidential makes the most sense.","given how much attention alleged voter fraud in one presidential race is garnering, this would be multiplied for every additional race."
Attack,it is difficult to create meaningful content in an educational environment without the ability to type on a keyboard and to work with text that goes beyond the few lines that fit on a mobile phone screen.,not being able to write type as fast and having less space for text forces the student to condense their notes into less space. this has been proven to improve memory and comprehension .

Attack,"the development of decision making parts of the brain does not follow a rigid timeline for all individuals, and some may exhibit mature decision making abilities earlier or later than the suggested age range.","it is not feasible for governments to individually determine whether a person is, developmentally, an adult. therefore, they have to use a general age threshold, at which most people are assumed to have achieved specific developmental milestones."
Support,public awareness of the real dangers of wild animals in zoological parks is poor.,there are different levels of risk according to different visitors' backgrounds.
Support,"president trump planned to introduce a new merit based system for legal immigration to the us, where those who could positively contribute to the economy would be given visas.",president trump called for an overhaul of the immigration system to make it merit based rather than lottery based.
Support,"even if religion is a sufficient condition for morality, it does not imply it is a necessary condition.","religion the belief in and worship of a supernatural power that guides us and morality the concept of right and wrong are two separate human constructs that only exist through language, communication and a common consensus, but cannot actually be verified and therefore neither exist unless we voluntarily believe and subscribe to them."
Support,male circumcision a procedure to which a child cannot consent is legal in most countries . denying gender affirming surgery to a consenting child while allowing non consensual genital mutilation is disingenuous.,"bans to outlaw male circumcision have been construed as an infringement of the right to religious freedom , yet the affected religious groups are often those most opposed to gender affirming surgery. this is hypocritical."
Attack,"any damages awarded to those bringing the case would require a universal collapse. either god would have to pay from sources within the universe causing an existential rift, tearing the universe apart or from outside the universe causing something somehow worse than an existential rift .","if god is a creator, he can simply manufacture the resources himself."
Attack,"pope francis' reluctance to reform the catholic church, a structurally and historically harmful institution, suggests an unwillingness to right its historical wrongs.",the church is a centuries old institution steeped in tradition. it's unreasonable to expect one pope to be able to progress the church in such limited time.
Attack,populations and regions who converted to catholicism didn't become substantially more ethical a prime example is the christianization of the roman empire which didn't change e.g. the widespread slavery .,it may have played an important role in the decline of roman entertainment gladiator games .
Attack,"the extenuating or mitigating circumstances that warrant a pardon for one particular individual may not generalize to all individuals convicted under the respective law, so blanket revocations should not be preferred.",mitigating and extenuating circumstances are taken into consideration when sentencing . the fact that these circumstances are reconsidered as relevant and significant to warrant a pardon for one individual but not others is unfair.
Attack,"god condemns murder and abortion, yet supports war and designs humans in a way that they die in birth and miscarry often.","the argument claims to know that the way we are now is how god originally intended, while providing no support for this claim. it is possible if you are theists, not just possible, but it happened that the design became corrupted."

Attack,there is no manuscript evidence whatsoever to support this claim.,the manuscripts lacking the interpolation may have been purposefully destroyed or lost.
Attack,this is an anthropomorphic analogy. it is a trait of human psychology and one in this case which is incorrect. comparing a human child to a feed lot animal is unbalanced in value. a feed lot animal if left in it's natural condition consumes plants and in turn is consumed by other animals. if humans were not eating them they would be eaten by other predators scavengers in the wild. their condition in life does not change much between feed lot and field.,"as discussed earlier, these animals are bred specifically for human consumption. if humans had not created these animals, they could not possibly be eaten by other predators scavengers in the wild."
Attack,many countries in the world import food in exchange for money.,majority of the countries importing the most food in the world have the potential to become completely food sufficient if they choose to do so.
Attack,buddhism is a complete and well established system of belief.,buddhism is more accurately considered a spiritual philosophy than a religion in the commonly understood sense.
Attack,having a good physique can help people overcome their insecurities. steroids can often help this endeavour.,it is not certain whether becoming more beautiful by your standards actually makes people feel less insecure.
Attack,homophobia and homophobic hate crimes are on the rise around the world.,"the rise in homophobic hate crime statistics are due to the improvements made by the police in their identification and recording of hate crime offences, and more people coming forward to report these crimes, rather than a genuine increase in the crimes in general."
Attack,this is not about anything leftist but about sustainable economics that address problems using novel means such as information technologies which is something never tried before and not dismissable as something that has historically existed that is very different.,"opposition to the free market, as indicated by objecting to the current system as merely things that an autonomous market rewards as profitable , is leftist."
Support,health care is necessary for people to live good and fulfilling lives.,health of individuals living in a society contributes to the greater good of the community.
Support,some countries may not have the resources necessary to institute travel bans.,strict travel bans would require the mobilization of border officers across land borders.
Attack,internalized gender norms and expectations limit self expression by establishing prescriptive ideals of what it means to belong to a certain gender.,"creating more options for expression does not imply greater happiness. often, more choice has the opposite effect ."
Attack,approaching strangers publicly for sex is harmful because it abets promiscuity.,"asking a stranger for sex is not necessarily promiscuous. many people may only want one sexual partner, and therfore may not engage in this behaviour frequently."
Attack,"even if conditions in neighboring middle and low income countries are not ideal, asylum acceptance rates in these countries are often higher and more stable than in high income countries, meaning that seeking asylum in nearby countries is likely the best option in most cases.","this is an argument to establish more stable asylum acceptance policies and to challenge the link between political rhetoric and refugees in high income countries, rather than a reason to encourage refugees to settle elsewhere."
Support,"in 2024, u.s. air force veteran whistleblower jake barber publicly claimed to have been part of a retrieval program describing various information about the program and peculiar aircraft which unlike david grusch he witnessed himself.",dr. col. john blitch backs what barber has been stating.
Attack,life involves pain and suffering. people that are aware of this and still choose to bring a life into the world are acting out of selfish desire.,it is unclear if occasional pain is worse than feeling nothing.

Attack,"there is no spatial limit to the diffusion of radioactive materials in the air, which allows particles to travel long distances and affect people half the planet away from the accident.","even though people around the globe were affected by radiation from fukushima, the amount was very low and on the level of one x ray scan."
Attack,it is impossible for an actual infinity to exist in the real world because it would result in absurdities .,"actual infinities might exist without these absurdities if only finite portions of them are accessible. for example, space may be infinite in extent, but we can only interact with our finite hubble volume ."
Attack,officers that have committed offenses against lgbtq members are reprimanded for doing so.this means the entire police force does not condone such behavior.,police officers do not receive proper punishment for targeted acts.
Attack,differences in socioeconomic status are already major drivers of social stratification. making those differences easy to identify runs the risk of further exacerbating this stratification.,"given that that social stratification on the basis of socioeconomics is already so pronounced, with people already making judgements on the basis of where someone lives, the clothes they wear and so on, it is unlikely that the proposed policy could have too pronounced an effect."
Support,it is one of the many ways in which parents associate a particular gender to a baby from birth.,this is problematic since it bypasses the baby's right to express their own gender identity.
Support,"internet platforms are ill suited to solve this problem, as identifying which posts should rightfully be removed or demoted brings great technical, legal, and moral challenges.","there are great technical challenges when deeming which speech is removable or demotable. some internet platforms are using artificial intelligence to solve this problem, but it is not yet an effective solution."
Support,gender neutral bathrooms help gender diverse individuals to express themselves in spite of rampant social exclusion and discrimination p. 271 .,"gender affirming care, including social transition , can reduce transgender and gender non conforming people's risk of suicide and poor mental health. gender neutral bathrooms may constitute a vital part of this."
Attack,giving a ubi to wealthy citizens is a waste of money and resources. the money is way better used to help those in hardship.,"the assumption that wealthy citizens will waste the money given to them is not implicit. on the contrary, it is possible that, on average, wealthy citizens will contribute more per dollar received than citizens in need."
Attack,"the reason they left was to ensure the continuance of slavery, which was in violation of the constitution itself.","the 13th amendment was signed on february 1, 1865 and the confederate army surrendered more than 2 months later on april 9th, 1865."
Attack,agi can be controlled and regulated to minimize its threat to humanity.,"if the agi cannot reason on its own for both physical and subjective moral implications of an action, then it's not an agi."
Attack,"if someone is frequently the victim of a crime by the same perpetrator, this also would make them fear.","there is no way to hide from a perpetrator with hate crime, as anyone could be a violent bigot."
Support,people who work for companies run by ultra wealthy individuals still report high levels of job satisfaction.,"google's top executives are among the world's richest, yet their employees report high levels of job satisfaction."
Support,religious rights are considered an insufficient justification for female circumcision. to give this as a reason for male circumcision creates a double standard.,"many argue that female circumcision is different, as it removes a sense organ . the foreskin has been shown to contain an enormous quantity of nerves comparable to that which is lost in female circumcision. huffingtonpost.com"
Attack,attacks like the charlie hebdo shooting demonstrate the violent response that muslims have to criticism or ridicule of islam.,"the attack was clearly unislamic , and was condemned loudly by muslims worldwide. therefore it does not demonstrate that islam is violent towards criticism and ridicule. on the contrary, it proved that when a few rebel against the religion, other muslims will speak up and call it out to publicly for their community and other communities."
Attack,allowing private business owners to determine who is considered a woman may lead to gender based discrimination.,policies applied to private groups and spaces are unlikely to affect national laws or wider social beliefs about gender.
Attack,walking is not feasible as a primary method of transportation for most people who live in large urban environments.,there are many cities in which residents regularly walk .

Support,the right to bodily autonomy cannot infringe upon the rights of others. not wearing a mask threatens other people's right to life and well being.,india's supreme court bench remarked that the right to life of others is violated by those who are not wearing masks.
Attack,that is an irrelevant conclusion. just because inflammatory language can incite anger does not mean that the dialogue at hand is unsubstantial.,meaningful discourse rarely happens in the presence of inflammatory language. inflammatory language communicates a lack of interest in the opposing side's argument and shuts down meaningful debate
Attack,"some portion of pay gap is proved to be due to discrimination e.g. us , united nations .","such a study is innately flawed as it does not look at facts, only at opinions and perceptions. based on the methodology used it could be described as a grievance study, as the data collection method is likely to skew the result. it does not scientifically, or factually, prove anything."
Support,"by claiming that something is human nature , you are inherently admitting a subject , which makes it by definition subjective. if morality is subjective, it can't depend on humanity or any other being.","'inherent to human nature' does not equate to 'objective truth', nor 'universal'. 'moral sense' may be a form of perception that is usually shared between humans, but is mind dependent."
Support,"the earth has a sufficient quantity of resources to host a growing population, people just need to learn to use them more efficiently.","society can circumvent resource depletion through technological innovation, which would improve energy capturing techniques."
Support,"this assumes that democracy is preferable to alternative political systems, which is not proven.",some scholars have argued that full democracy is not preferable to more authoritarian systems.
Attack,"this is a false analogy . there is no contradiction here, because you can say i should not have another cookie at one moment, and eat it at another moment. in the case of argumentation, if you still claim to be a participant in the argumentation, then it would be a contradiction to assert its meaninglessness. otherwise, you are no longer involved in the argumentation.","while it is possible to say i should not eat another cookie , change one's mind, decide i should , and then eat a cookie, that is obviously not the behaviour the analogy refers to. saying false analogy without understanding an analogy is just a blind guess."
Attack,western civilization predates christianity; there were a variety of indigenous religions in the pre christian world.,"the term western civilization replaced the term european civilization, which referred to an area previously known as christendom , based on the essential contributions of christianity to its culture and politics."
Attack,the aspirational beauty norm of thinness already makes average sized people less happy with their bodies. shaming obesity on top of that makes them even more likely to be self conscious.,"if average sized people are feeling irrationally bad about their bodies right now, there is no reason to believe that fat acceptance would suddenly enlighten them."
Support,"the commercialization of agriculture was harmful to the local people, as it imposed selfish capitalist ideals on a community that previously cultivated crops for individual consumption.","the british introduced the zamindari system in india , which significantly harmed the farmers who worked the land. this inhumane system was ultimately abolished by the government of india after independence."
Attack,"we cannot decide which parts of history to remember and which parts to ignore. every part of our history is part of our history, whether we like it or not, unless there is an objective moral framework against which we're all willing to submit ourselves to. it's clear there isn't. we need to respect the facts and leave them as they are.","to say there is no 'objective moral framework' is to wipe your hands of this discussion, for this is a moral debate. the existence of any monuments or statues indicates a subjective moral decision by individuals governments business to glorify particular events ideas figures. this debate is not about remembering history, but of which parts of history we, as a society, deem worthy of moral glorification."
Support,"freedom, in its truest sense, means that responsibility is optional. as such, sexual responsibility is not necessarily a burden, but rather a personal choice.",taking responsibility is empowering; it will make you more confident .
Attack,"one can identify different cause areas as most pressing with varying values, ethics or perspectives applied where the top spot can vary even on the level of one individual if the individual does not commit exclusively to any of these ethics or value sets.","that means there is not an objectively correct answer to the question under discussion, but does not change what the question is. it would be similarly wrong to, in a debate about the best movie of all time, conflate this with whether a particular movie is merely very good, even though such a question is obviously subjective."
Attack,persistent hate speech may lead to victims censoring their own opinions and speech out of fear that they will be attacked.,hate speech is a relatively insignificant cause of self censorship. the spiral of silence is a common phenomenon on social media where people self censor when others are critical of their opinions.
Attack,"that would still only be the mid future and may not contradict nowhere near , especially since that is only a rough estimate without detailed reasoning and not meeting standards of e.g. scientific 'projections'.",one meaningful anchor for what near vs nowhere near could refer to would be within our lifetimes . 2061 is near by this criterion.
Attack,"a failure to do so, such when prime minister göran persson did not inform the monarch of swedish victims in the 2004 indian tsunami , draws criticism .",the prime ministers and his cabinet were mainly criticised for inaction or delayed action in their handling of the tragedy .
Support,sex workers are more likely to be included in feminist spaces than patriarchal ones.,sex workers are often presented in reductive and sexist ways in traditional media; feminist media is often more respectful .
Support,market forces can still be in effect even if the product is a necessity rather than a commodity.,"if there is more than one healthcare provider in an area, this will discourage one of the providers from inflating their prices or reducing their quality, because people can get healthcare somewhere else. in this way market forces can help improve healthcare outcomes assuming there's enough competition, even if the product involved is a necessity rather than a commodity."
Support,"a more progressive church would be likely to attract more followers, as many people have left the church due to how conservative it is.",a more progressive church would offer more opportunities for a younger demographic who are less connected to historical traditions.
Support,"religions are living and change to adapt to their adherents' beliefs; if the majority of muslims support gender equality, then such beliefs will ultimately become part of the religion.",religions are social institutions and can consequently be interpreted through the lens of their adherents.
Attack,cases where mental harms are legislated against tend to be ones where victims suffer significantly in an overwhelming number of cases. it is not clear that hate speech is harmful to such a degree.,pervasive hate speech is tied to increased immigrant suicide rates in europe.
Attack,"the feeling of bad is an incoherent concept without some standard of good to depart from. there is no standard that grounds the good apart from god. thus, if god doesn t exist, then the feeling of badness doesn t exist. it is just some illusion. it isn t objectively real. therefore, this argument fails. it depends on god s existence to succeed.","the feeling of 'badness' exists, even if it is an illusion. it is real in the sense that we feel it."
Attack,universal health care would be incredibly costly and therefore detrimental to the economy.,"many countries provide universal healthcare , showing that any detrimental economic effects are not substantial."

Attack,the reference to story of lot and the destruction of sodom in the quran proves that acts of homosexuality should be punished.,"saying something does not make it true, as the quran says that the earth is flat and that slavery is not immoral, both of which are false."
Support,"minorities' capacity to be recognised for their authentic cultural experiences is recent, and often comes in recognition of the backlash to cultural appropriation. this may decrease with time.","through constant innovation , capitalism appears to render traditions obsolete meaning, that they have to be merged, blended, or signficantly adapted to remain relevant. this suggests that cultural appropriation and the warping of traditions is likely to continue and that current recognition due to backlash may be short lived."
Attack,christianity helped with the development of western science.,"during the early middle ages, christian europe held back scientific progress. it was the islamic world that kept it alive."
Attack,"politicians can use the death penalty to appeal to their base, or position themselves as law and order candidates.",some politicians can and have campaigned on abolishing the death penalty.
Attack,"presidents only represent the people who vote for them. they are naturally divisive figures. they cannot represent all the people of the nation in the same way that an impartial, unelected person can.","while monarchs may not be partisan in terms of politics or at least not publicly they are not impartial, they are the embodiment of a system that divides citizens by origin and that considers a specific lineage to be over the rest."
Support,a lack of suffering does not necessarily mean nothing bad has happened to the baby.,"when you're shot in the head, you don't feel anything, but that doesn't mean nothing bad happened."
Support,public healthcare budgets costs often outstrip the ability of the host nation to pay them without increasing national debt that would eventually demand tax increases.,many countries have large outstanding debts to medical companies.

Attack,"by necessity, the harry potter movies had to shorten the book plots due to runtime limits. a tv series could accurately portray the events from the books without these constraints.","the adaptation process itself involves creative choices that may not align with all fans' expectations, and a tv series might still need to condense or alter certain elements to fit within the medium's constraints."

Attack,"women with low iq are more fertile than those with high iq. given that intelligence is heritable , higher fertility among low iq women could lower the average iq of a society.","the relationship between iq and fertility is at least partially attributable to extraneous factors such as education , socioeconomic status , and social mobility . reducing socioeconomic inequality would, therefore, increase iq while also controlling fertility without necessitating population control methods."

Attack,"women are negatively judged for having a high number of sexual partners, more so than men. approaching strangers for sex may demonstrate sexual confidence, and suggest a high number of partners, thus drawing ire.","publicly asking for sex from a stranger is not the same as having a large number of sexual partners. therefore, it is unlikely women will be shamed for this behaviour."
Attack,"we can eat meat responsibly choose carefully, develop small productions and local food, and make it a rare and savoured special dish.",this would only work if all other meat production was stopped. maybe stopping meat consumption in the present is the most effective way to get this to come about.

Attack,christianity does not just claim that this is consistent with it as a worldview. this evidence enhances the likelihood that the christian worldview is true because it expects or anticipates people to believe in false gods and to continue believing in false gods.,it is hard to say they anticipate and expect people to believe in false gods when at the time of its inception people were believing in many different gods and religions all across the planet. it is not a prediction if it was already happening.
Attack,teachers have a duty of care towards vulnerable children. this outweighs their rights towards free expression of religion.,the apparel worn by teachers does not hurt the children physically or psychologically.

Attack,capital punishment contributes to solving the problem of overpopulation in the prison system.,there are not enough executions to have any significant effect on prison populations.

Attack,"a ban on self pardons would be futile, due to the existence of legal workarounds . following resignation or removal from office, the vice president, who assumes office as president, can simply pardon their predecessor.","an incumbent who pardons an impeached president may be perceived as corrupt by the general public, resulting in the loss of future elections . thus, in tandem with the threat of impeachment, the electorate holds presidents accountable."

Support,the four horsemen of new atheism successfully pushed themselves to the forefront of public debates on religion.,"the work of christopher hitchens was brave and honest, lending new atheism moral authority."
Attack,"this is a non sequitur based on narrow definitions. atheism is not limited to agnosticism as it also includes those who say no god exists . even assuming only agnostic atheism, the conclusion still does not follow. it is correct to say that science cannot conclude on the existence of the supernatural. therefore science does not justify or refute the rejection of a god exists.","atheism is not taking the position that there is a god. positive atheism is the belief that there are no gods. since this debate is entitled science doesn't justify atheism we take the more general definition. then, we look at how the scientific method evaluates claims. a rejected claim does not mean that the claim is false. rejecting a claim means it has not been shown to be true. since both science and atheism do not accept the claim a god exists as true, science justifies atheism."

Support,"undermining the ability to develop, distribute, or contribute to open source ai systems sets the stage for china to extend its influence into the world s developing ai infrastructure which some argue would be problematic due to china's techno authoritarian values .",not doing so may allow chinese firms to develop many of the open source ai models that will form the foundation of much of the world's critical infrastructure.

Support,"the dominant cultural norms of masculinity and femininity are constantly changing p. 3 . binary pronouns, therefore, are outdated and the use of additional pronouns should be normalized.",the role of women in much of the west has evolved in many ways in the last 200 years. embracing these changes in traditions can be positive.
Attack,"while people with intersex conditions may present with sex characteristics that are atypical of the sex to which they belong, that doesn't mean they were incorrectly sexed.","people who are intersex are usually assumed to be regularly fertile women. it isn t until much later in life, if at all, that they are discovered to have a lack of ovaries. if you agree they are correctly sexed at birth, then the presence of ovaries is not the defining trait of women or females."
Support,"the matthew and mark passages happen before jesus is given the vinegar on a sponge, while the luke and john passages happen after he is given the vinegar on a sponge.",mark 15:34 happens before jesus is given the vinegar on a sponge in 15:36.
Attack,it is not possible for humans to create something that complex that no human can understand. all the abilities of the agi are in a framework made by humans who have control over it.,a self learning artificial intelligence could exceed any other ai overnight in level and pace. this would likely mean a significant control over the rest of the internet.
Support,"the removal of borders would greatly reduce technical innovations in developed countries. since these nations have a disproportionately high influence on global gdp, any knock to their economies as a result of border removals would have a highly negative impact on the world's economy.","although the removal of borders may provide a short term stimulus to global gdp, in the long term , the slowing down of innovation leads to a massively reduced gdp and quality of life for future generations."
Attack,some of the toughest ever sanctions on putin's allies in russia were put in place while trump was president.,"the sanctions mentioned were not the work of president trump. the sanctions upheld in january 2017 were originally imposed by obama , and those from august 2018 were pushed through by a veto proof majority in congress."

Support,"whilst some open source projects have large numbers of contributors, it can often be the case that a well resourced closed source project will have more developers working on it than open source alternatives.","when the heartbleed vulnerability was discovered, openssl was maintained by only a handful of volunteers, only one of whom worked full time."
Attack,there are reports of abusive behavior by men pretending to be trans women accessing women only spaces in order to prey on vulnerable women.,a small handful of problematic individuals should not be allowed to undermine sincere efforts to make women only spaces more inclusive or prevent trans people from accessing them.
Attack,"president trump also stated that 'fake news' was any news about him that he disliked, disagreed with, or was otherwise negative about him.","fox news s chris wallace , who received an award for excellence in journalism in 2017, stated that when president trump talked about bias in the media , he had a point."
Support,interstellar transport is feasible and alien life not unlikely. with 2020s spaceflight tech 0.06 speed of light sol the entire galaxy would be traversable in 0.15 bn years. it is likely that 0 much older civilizations have faster means of spaceflight and are closer. replicating probes could quickly reach many galactic regions if intended if nothing stops or prevents them. colonization may spread through our galaxy with 5 sol in 1.4 m years 20 seem feasible . some are likely motivated.,"there are also other propulsion technology approaches other than the light sail concept where 20 of the speed of light seems feasible, that could also be relatively fast. already speculated methods range from nano or micro sized probes over self replicating probes with embryos to slow cryonic generation ships. it seems likely that within 200 years and perhaps much sooner humanity may be able to send many small smart interstellar probes and many other civilizations may have done so."
Attack,"the movie begins with a power imbalance of first order superior in technology and might, the resistance inferior in technology and might. at the end of the film, nothing has changed.","at the start of the last jedi, the resistance are attempting to recruit a jedi, luke and at the conclusion they have a jedi, rey which would represent a change in the power balance."

Support,"there is no consensus among researchers about the significance of different findings, their meaning, or what conclusions may be drawn from the libet studies.","libet's studies are based on the assumption that decision making is instantaneous, when in fact the brain activity of a decision could be ongoing or could build up over time p. 53 . this would explain libet's counterintuitive results and create room for free will."
Support,the us does not have the right or jurisdiction to act independently on the matter.,engaging the issue of the war in ukraine is the purview of the un security council unsc .
Attack,meat production creates significant greenhouse gas emissions which contribute to climate change.,"most of these sources of greenhouse gasses comes from beef production ; other sources of meat, such as pork, poultry, and mutton produce significantly less of these gasses, so it may be beneficial to merely tax the largest culprits rather than all sources."
Attack,homeschooling families save money on expenditures which public schools would otherwise demand. this can make them more secure and less likely to get into conflicts about money.,"in the us, the brunt of public schooling costs are paid through household taxes . regardless of where their children attend school, homeschooling parents are required to pay these taxes."

Attack,"the intent of chelsea russell cannot be determined with absolute authority but it is commonly cited that she was doing it out of respect. even if she was trolling, the option to delete her comment and block her from the page exists. criminal prosecution is excessive, disproportionate, and requires the assumption of her mindset at the time, which is exactly what people are accusing political correctness of being; thought policing.",intent is legally determined in court cases. courts have been given this authority.
Support,many animals seem to value life . this could be seen as a universal value system.,"the ability to value something depends on the ability to predict positive and negative experiences. humans attribute positive or negative value to something to the extent that humans believe it brings positive or negative experiences. this ability is not uniquely human, but widespread in the animal kingdom."
Attack,"while an arranged marriage may be more efficient or reliable, one misses out on many things which characterize the journey of finding someone to marry in a love marriage.","if the ultimate goal is marriage, then any time spent in romantic relationships that may not result in marriage is an inefficient use of one s time."

Attack,bone is a good material that we used to make our early tools.,"we do not still use bone tools. the opening statement is not we should never have eaten meat , but we should stop now ."
Support,"requiring gender diverse students to attend mixed sex schools is not unfair, so long as they are guaranteed high quality education. whether they have the same number of options as cisgender students is irrelevant.","parents of intersex students would be spared the challenge of deciding whether their child should attend a single sex or mixed sex school, which is complicated by conflicting opinions and research findings on student outcomes."
Support,"robert e. lee opposed secession, but fought for his homeland when he was called upon to defend it.","they do not know what they say. if it came to a conflict of arms, the war will last at least four years. northern politicians will not appreciate the determination and pluck of the south, and southern politicians do not appreciate the numbers, resources, and patient perseverance of the north. both sides forget that we are all americans. i foresee that our country will pass through a terrible ordeal, a necessary expiation, perhaps, for our national sins. robert e. lee"
Attack,"civil disobedience implies that anyone can disobey laws they believe to be unjust, which undermines the purpose of having laws in the first place.",this assumes laws are disobeyed merely because people believe they are unjust. there could be cases where there is more than a mere belief.

Attack,"it is clearly immoral to forcefully impose religious practices on adults who do not consent to participating in those practices. since small children are incapable of offering consent, it is similarly immoral to impose religious practices on small children.","if it is immoral to impose religious practices on one's children as part of their education, then it is likewise immoral to impose secular practices such as curfews and bedtimes, going to the doctor and dentist regularly, getting shots and vaccines, and going to school."
Attack,it is generally studied that the most favorable form of government is benevolent dictatorship.,"the extent to which there is a superior form of governance is the extent to which it maybe done within anarchism, voluntarily. the extent to which it will be forced is the extent to which it will no longer be subject to the market force of public opinions such as the opinions of its morality ."
Support,"the meaning of efficient teaching , and how it differs from a mere class, is unclear, but is not necessarily supportive of a change in the curriculum.","in the limit, one could define efficient teaching of a concept to be successful at teaching that concept by definiton but if it is hard or impossible to teach that concept, that would just make efficient teaching unattainable and efficient teaching of that concept would still not be a good addition to the currivulum."

Attack,"jesus' effect on human history is attributable to his followers' belief that he was the messiah. using this to prove that he was the messiah is, therefore, circular.","if a person is willing to die for some belief, there is good reason to consider that the belief is grounded in reality. the disciples were willing to die for the belief that jesus rose from the dead, therefore it is reasonable to consider the reality that jesus did in fact rise from the dead."

Support,"how pressing a cause area is depends on factors that include or are: severity of negative impact e.g. in terms of daly , severity of risk likelihood impact , timing when the issue is relevant and can be addressed , and how much can be done about it in the respective timeframe. not much more can be done about existential risks from misaligned ai risks at this point without further things being clear, it would become more pressing only once more can be done.","things that can be done are close to being saturated, essentially having plateaued. there is a lot of research, development, and awareness about the alignment problem and when it comes to existential risks from ai in specific, not much more can be done from the current standpoint. for example, one can hardly address issues in ai architectures more than done by now if those architectures haven't been built and aren't anticipated."
Attack,"no one is purely feminine or purely masculine. by that logic, everyone would be non binary. however, those who actually describe themselves as non binary would not be happy with that implication.","feminine and masculine are gender roles , whereas non binary is a gender identity. it is, therefore, legitimate for non binary people to be unhappy with the conflation of binary gender roles with their non binary identity."
Support,"economic elites and corporate interest groups have substantial influence on us government policy gilens and page, p. 1 .","the changing of economic distributions is evidence of the rich's growing influence on policy through the use of campaign finance contributions. since 1980, the wealthiest 1 of households have seen their incomes rise 2.3 times, the top 0.1 of household a rise of more than 4 times, and the top 0.01 of households a rise of more than 6 times."

Attack,this claim makes it explicitly clear that unplanned motherhood causes women to suffer. to want to put unwilling women through suffering for the rest of their lives is inhumane.,"the parent never said that unplanned motherhood causes women to suffer. it simply states there may be consequences to having an unplanned baby, whatever that may be."
Support,"it is cruel, but morality is a very relative concept. in the perspective of the animal kingdom, we are part of the omnivore group, and eating meat is what our species do, as many many others. applying morality to nature is pointless, many other species cause harm to many others. applying the term morality to meat eating is pointless and counterproductive to the actual goal: to reduce harm to some animals.",the illusion of being more than nature or above nature is created by actual society. the detachment from simple things as finding our own food make us believe we are not animals but the biology says otherwise.
Support,"the bible has all of humanity descending from noah and his ark mates, but humans have a wide variety of skin tones and physical features that differ based upon geographic heritage. why this is so, the bible says not, but evolution has scientific explanations for all of these differences.","lactose tolerance was a benefit derived from the domestication of milk producing animals by certain groups of humans, such as the mongols."
Support,the manufacturing of processed and packaged foods has devastating environmental impacts .,an estimated 19 percent of total energy mostly from non renewable sources used in the usa is taken up in the production and supply of food.
Attack,it would be impossible to measure and or implement a majority standard of morality because it would have to take into account all people and people groups simultaneously and the standard would constantly change with the populations and their subjective influences.,"it would be challenging, but i'm not sure impossible. for instance: assume god does not exist; likely there would still be a majority standard that murder for simplicity sake defined as it is by law is morally wrong."
Attack,"military aircraft, such as fighter jets , can also be used to shoot down surveillance balloons.","while the f 22 was able to shoot down a chinese balloon, the jet's ability to consistently shoot down high altitude balloons is still untested ."
Attack,"jesus first met the disciples in jerusalem luke 24:33, 36 ; matthew 28:8 9 , then jesus told them to go to galilee matthew 28:10 , where jesus met them again matthew 28:16 .","matthew 28:8 9 refer to jesus meeting the women, not the disciples. in 28:10 jesus says, do not be afraid. go and tell my brothers to go to galilee; there they will see me. thus, it is false that, according to matthew, jesus met his disciples in jerusalem before meeting them in galilee."
Attack,religions allow people with similar moral views to associate together for their mutual benefit. such religions do not however authorise their adherents to impose their views upon others,"evangelical groups preach their views to others. at times, this may fall into the category of imposing their views upon other people."

Attack,studies have shown that pay transparency increases dissatisfaction among those who are paid below the median wage.,this is not necessarily a bad thing. job dissatisfaction caused by pay transparency may highlight unfair company practices that need addressing.
Attack,homosexuality goes against the major branches of the world's dominant religions .,"the world's dominant religions are seeing a rise in violent terrorist movements who encourage all old text based decrees, causing much suffering securitymagazine.com . therefore, those dominant religions should not emphasize extremist mindsets, such as outlawing homosexuality, in order to avoid extremists' pushing adherence to the whole texts, such as enforcing women's roles. taliban views on women"
Attack,"human historical timeline is divided into two eras, before christ bc and anno domini ad . this shows that the entire human history centers around christ as the reference.","jesus' effect on human history is attributable to his followers' belief that he was the messiah. using this to prove that he was the messiah is, therefore, circular."

Support,it may be possible to make israeli violations of international law in their dealing with palestine less frequent if the us recognises the latter state.,"the un fact finding mission in gaza found that some of the actions of the government of israel might justify a competent court finding that crimes against humanity have been committed. if palestine was recognised as a sovereign state, these crimes would receive more attention and condemnation internationally."

Attack,ai will democratize the production and scope of art.,the use of ai in the creative sector will undermine the value of art.
Support,"if hate speech were prohibited, the expression of hateful opinions would seem even more hateful than before. restrictions may, therefore, make the speech even more jarring and hurtful.","this would give hateful voices even more power over the groups of people they hate, as their speech would appear to be even more shocking."
Attack,the ability to leave reviews is a way the market strongly encourages health organisations to deliver a quality service.,reviews do not provide adequate assurance to consumers as many are fake .
Support,men may abuse the self identification protocols in order to harm those who do genuinely identify as women in women only spaces.,"men's rights groups have targeted women only spaces in the past. if men are allowed to enter into such spaces by claiming to identify as women, these groups may use the opportunity to undermine and possibly destroy these spaces."

Attack,presidential pardons are inconsistent with a democratic system of governance.,"the us is a constitutional democracy or, more accurately, constitutional federal republic . the constitution upon which the state is founded gives the president the power to pardon."

Attack,reactionary responses include actively advocating hatred toward all men. this is not an uncommon theme.,"radical feminists think that rape is a consequence of patriarchy , which is a social system, the idea of it being genetically designed doesn't exist in feminism"

Support,"songs, footage from other ip, and more cost an excessive amount of money to license, and this does not matter if the material is repeatedly used, or if a snippet is used within a commercial project, ai merely just circumvents the licensing process.","grand theft auto's radio music is beloved but not significant to the gameplay, yet rockstar spends money to license these songs to use inside the series."
Support,society generally sets limits on self actualization once it hurts society.,people shouldn't be allowed to murder other people just because it allows them to acheive self actualization.
Attack,"appealing to the social agreement would not be an appeal to an objective standard but merely a mutually agreed upon subjective standard. the agreement of any number of people can only make it intersubjective among them, but not objective.","the mutually agreed upon subjective standard is just that. the requirement that any social agreement fitting that description is necessary for morality, is itself the appeal to the objective standard."
Attack,christians have used violence to convert people of other faiths.,the predominant means by which christianity spread throughout society was strategic evangelization rather than violence.
Support,"the intensity of a preference for gatekeeping often derives from an irrational assumption of harm and bad intentions from others. as this is not always true , this preference should be considered less important.","speech is a vital validation mechanism , therefore cultural appropriation and offense should be remediated with counterspeech . this allows for a reconciliation between preferences."
Attack,"matter is composed of tiny fundamental particles that cannot be further broken down. as a different collection of fundamental particles could have existed instead of the collection that does exist, matter doesn t exist necessarily.",the fundamental particles may exist in the only way they can exist.
Attack,"mankind is most directly responsible for the elimination of species; therefore, mankind has a moral responsibility to de extinct them.",the act of de extincting the species could act to remove the guilt felt and as a consequence encourage the continuation of the exploitation that caused the extinction. we could potential act under the pretence that our negative actions no longer matter as we can just bring back the species in the end.
Support,"innovation in and of itself is not crucial to education, as not all changes are positive.","the enormous trend of technologizing classrooms is widely lauded as innovative; however, the prevalence of classroom technology may have deleterious effects on student learning."
Attack,oil palm plantations in indonesia and malaysia pose significant threats to endangered elephants and tigers.,vegans and vegetarians do not consume a significant amount more palm oil than meat eaters
Attack,"mandatory voting would be a shared social experience for most people, which could make voters feel more responsible for the actions and policies of their chosen political party.",an individual voting for a politician based on policies they promised to implement is not the same as an individual feeling responsible for policies they end up implementing when in power.
Support,"gender neutral bathrooms could lead to higher levels of sexual assault, harassment, or peeping .",making bathrooms gender neutral removes a safe place for those being harassed by someone of a different gender.

Attack,"voting theorists are the ones who spend time connecting the ideas to reality, so they are better equipped to manage campaigns and think about advertising to different levels of society than voters.","a voting method that is less easily understood is less democratic, and has less legitimacy in the eyes of the people, who may then feel the method has little or no benefit for them, and is instead an academic exercise or otherwise meant to appease other political interests, rather than them."
Support,"if the colony is not self sustaining, it would be ultimately ineffective in the long term.","if we stayed on earth, we could've had a better chance to survive. however, since we would be on mars, we'd face elements worse than on earth and run a greater risk of extinction that it actually causes it for us."

Attack,"robert e. lee is remembered for his sense of honor and duty. in fact , he was not a staunch supporter of slavery or secession but fought for these ideas because they had been more or less democratically decided upon.",the democratic process in this case is undermined by the fact that in the confederate south only white males were allowed to participate. slaves and even free blacks were not considered a part of the polis.
Attack,the poor design of imf programs results in negative economic impacts on the countries receiving the loans.,the problem might not be the design of the programs but rather poor enforcement and implementation.
Support,genetically modified seeds and associated research technologies are patented by a minority of major corporations p. xix . these patents can be used to financially exploit smaller scale players in the gmo industry. a blanket ban on gm food would be the surest way to prevent this.,"if patented gmo seeds contaminate neighbouring land and grow there, the owners of this land can be sued for patent infringement by monsanto."

Support,"the more social pressure there is on certain kinds of research, the more interest and attention it garners. this has several upshots that enhance objectivity.","the more social interest certain research fields attract, the more scientists will want to contribute to it. this is likely to increase the numbers of scientists peer reviewing papers in the field or replicating important studies."
Support,"the competition to provide the lowest price can lead to exploitation and environmental issues that could be avoided by ethical, socialist manufacturing practices.","due to the nature of capitalism, the aim of any business is to bring to most value at the lowest cost. this leads to workers being underpaid or products being made cheaply and poorly."

Attack,"the bible is not a science textbook, so it does not talk about topics such as evolution that are unimportant for spirituality.","if god exists, then spirituality is compatible with science"
Attack,"gender quotas will encourage women to exhibit sexist attitudes towards other women, which is counter productive.","there is no reason that gender quotas need to lead to women exhibiting sexist attitudes themselves. competition for positions already exists and these quotas would likely open more doors for women, rather than making them turn against one another."

Attack,"given the right of individuals to the freedom of contract , it is the responsibility of the state to adopt bitcoin as legal tender, giving it legal validity like they do with other contracts. this is because bitcoin is a privately issued currency, transacted on a peer to peer network, between two mutually consenting and willing parties .",in countries where bitcoin is illegal bitcoin transactions are not enforceable using contract law because contracts relating to illegal goods are not legally enforceable .

Attack,"tiktok's policy of censorship infringes upon americans' freedom of expression, making the platform itself a restriction on this fundamental right.","the government should not wield authority over the information its citizens consume, as citizens cannot opt out of governmental restrictions in the same way they can from those imposed by private platforms."
Attack,"the act of using argumentation in an attempt to discover truth and resolve conflicts implies certain ethical norms, such as preferring to use reason instead of force and preferring truth over falsehood. to argue against objective morality is thus a performative contradiction.","the link between the ethical norms underpinning argumentation and morality is completely opaque. it seems prima facie quite possible for morality to be subjective, and that we may discover this through argumentation."
Support,"if the goal is dispersion of power, moving control from rich capitalists to the state does not fix the issue. it instead exacerbates the problem by transferring that power from a larger group of people the rich capitalists to a smaller group of people government leaders who already control laws, regulations, and armed forces. you ultimately end up with more concentration of power, not less.","this is perfectly exemplified by stalin who purged and executed others within his party ,in order to consolidate supreme power over government and capital."

Attack,"as of 2023, the u.s. and possibly other countries with seemingly higher numbers of incidents are special in various ways and hence could warrant higher frequency of incidents.","in many ways there are not special, such as average lifespan, health, or quality of life and various per capita metrics."
Support,"despite being referred to grammatically with male gendered pronouns, allah is neither male nor female .",the form of he used to refer to allah in arabic is the default pronoun used for the third person singular without reference to gender .
Attack,"if punctuated equilibrium the belief that evolutionary changes occur over relatively quick periods of time, followed by periods of time with little or no evolutionary change is true, science cannot discover the links between species in the fossil record because the change from one species to another occurs too rapidly, geologically speaking, to leave any fossil documentation of the transition.","gould one of the founders of punctuated equilibrium has said himself since we proposed punctuated equilibria to explain trends, it is infuriating to be quoted again and again by creationists whether through design or stupidity, i do not know as admitting that the fossil record includes no transitional forms. transitional forms are generally lacking at the species level, but they are abundant between larger groups. transitional species are still to be found and have been found in abundance."

Support,people would feel safer if they knew there were fewer guns around.,responsible citizens would be more likely to give up carrying guns if they knew that there were fewer guns in the hands of criminals.
Attack,"not eating meat means not farming animals, not farming animals means no money to feed them, no money to feed them means no more cattle, chicken, pigs, etc. as long as we live in a capitalist system economy.","this may be a benefit, as human raised livestock is often kept in atrocious conditions, and also has negative environmental impacts. farming also has negative impacts on humans."
Attack,it is possible to posit a type of non classical god who willingly blinds himself to our choices and thus preserves free will.,"most notions of god assume omniscience. for god to know everything, but not know everything that we may choose at the same time is incoherent."

Attack,"unless this were coupled with harder curriculums, it would trigger an influx of college graduates, meaning bachelors degrees would decrease in value and graduates would be forced to earn masters degrees in order to stay competitive in the work force.",there is currently a lack of skilled labour in the us. an influx in college graduates will solve this problem before a devaluation of degrees can occur.
Attack,naturism is still a small market. naturist businesses may grow and coordinate with each other as public nudity is normalized and popularized.,"with normalized public nudity, the popularity of naturist clubs may decrease, thereby reducing the benefits they might have provided."
Support,protesting is an individuals way of communicating their views and ideas to the government; similar to a pressure group. this is essential for the government to continue to serve the people.,it is illegitimate for the state to stop people from voicing their opinion to one another. opinions are subjective and it is not the role of any authority to determine which ones are normatively acceptable. this policy limits the capacity of pro lifers to express their opinions.
Attack,"jesus healed many ill people, without the help of medicines or medicinal tools.",faith healing is a practice continued today in many religions. people still claim to have been healed without the help of medicines or medical tools.

Support,archaeological evidence supports the existence of key figures and events mentioned in the bible.,archaeological evidence has backed up the existence of jesus.
Support,it does not logically follow from the fact that evil exists that the monotheistic god as traditionally conceived cannot exist.,the concept of evil is entailed by the concept of good as its opposite.
Attack,"in the past, jews have been killed and expelled from the territory now known as palestine. recognizing palestine could legitimize these historic atrocities and jeopardize israel.",it is not clear how recognising self determination for palestinians would legitimise historical violence and anti semitism.
Attack,the magnitude of the earthquakes was so great that even stronger building regulations would not have been able to prevent this disaster.,the resilience of the european cultural center situated in the center of adıyaman following the earthquake indicates that enhanced building standards could have mitigated the detrimental effects of the seismic activity.
Attack,"the idea that jesus was resurrected caused the early christians to rethink many of the entrenched traditions in their older religion, judaism. this would be unlikely without a genuine miracle. christiananswers.net",some jewish communities may have been expecting a dying and rising messiah based on readings of the so called suffering servant passages in isaiah.

Support,"often members of the royal family are also entitled to an allocation or inclusion in the civil list government payments to the head of state in a monarchy. in republics, however, an allocation is only made to the president.","in the netherlands, the regnant monarch and the crown prince are included in the civil list. there s also a possibility of allocations to the former monarch and their spouse pg.249 . a similar arrangement is also practised in norway pg.247 and luxembourg pg.259 ."
Support,"gender dysphoria screening and diagnosis rely on self reporting. those with greater insight into their condition will, therefore, receive a more accurate diagnosis and, consequently, more effective treatment.","given the lack of advances made in medically diagnosing gender dysphoria, self reporting is often the only accessible method available to patients."
Support,"the passages of the bible that permit exodus 21:10 , deuteronomy 21:15 , 2 samuel 12:8 and condemn genesis 2:24 , leviticus 18:18 , deuteronomy 17:17 , 1 corinthians 7:2 polygamy can be reconciled with polygamy being condemned.",2 samuel 12:8 can be reconciled with polygamy being condemned.

Support,political correctness masks the fact that good intentions are more important than proper words.,"pc culture can negate heading towards something good, due to misunderstandings ."
Attack,it will not have been worth the sacrifice if we destroy the earth or a multitude of species go extinct before we get to an alien planet.,"natural selection and natural disasters are responsible for more destruction and death we just call it change than humanity can ever accomplish as the dominant species on the planet. on the other hand we do actively work against the destruction deterioration of earth, and even keep many species of animals, that would go extinct without us, in the game for a little while longer."
Attack,this claim only applies to theologies which don't make sense. there are theologies which do make sense.,making sense is a subjective term. i could defend that the bill gates theology makes the same sense than any other religion. you just need to have faith. this isn't something new and it's called the russells' teapot argument.
Attack,people have a right to bodily autonomy and should ultimately be able to make choices about what happens to their bodies.,"the foetus is not part of one's body but a separate entity. therefore, the pregnant person is not just making a decision about their body when they get an abortion."
Support,school programs focused on the well being of children can end up doing more harm than good .,increased school security and zero tolerance behavior policies intended to protect students often have negative repercussions p. 4 .
Support,politicians should prioritize the well being of the country over their own political power.,"while political power is temporary, the effects of some policies could linger permanently, affecting both leaders and citizens alike."
Attack,"healthcare consumers' decisions are, more often then not, driven by short term considerations that, in the long run, could be detrimental to their health.",people are not idiots. they will follow the counsel of their doctor.
Support,the occupation allows israel to stifle and control the economy of the west bank and gaza.,israel's control over palestinian land use violates international regulations and deprives palestinians of essential resources p. 31 .

Attack,"through capitalism, the world has gotten better at an incredible rate.","capitalism has led to an increase in inequality , which has detrimental effects on the well being of people."
Attack,"lacking a detailed narrative of how a given existential risk which existential risk exactly? may occur. the issue doesn't seem well defined and relies on some unspecified sequence of event that may lead to some vague but really bad future, given the current trajectory. while it is important to come to understand the potential risks, it's absurd to argue that this poorly defined hypothetical issue is more important than actually happening and demonstrably impactful issues.","if we lived in a world where ai x risk was merely a poorly defined hypothetical, this would mean there was insufficient research and work on understanding and narrowing down ai x risk, and that it's tractable and neglected. combined with the inherent potential importance of an existential risk, this would make a very pressing cause area."
Support,"economics, including trade relations, and politics are strongly related .",fairtrade recognises and supports governmental efforts to make international trade more equitable.
Attack,"income inequality leaves people discontent and generates pressure for income redistribution, which could lead to political upheavel and the creation of a non democratic but anti systemic or redistributive regime p. 3 .",predictions that income inequality will undermine democratization are at best weakly supported by the empirical evidence p. 1 .
Support,many approaches to transhumanism aren't a step in evolution but a replacement for it.,"transhumanism could reverse evolution. artificial enhancement that does not affect the dna of people who are, according to their dna, the least fit, could ensure their survival and procreation with bad dna , thus reversing evolution."
Support,wider use of ai in the creative sector would improve the quality of art that is produced.,ai could contribute to the creation of art that humans could not make on their own.
Attack,negligently infecting a person with a disease is immoral and criminal.,"because over 80 of adults have herpes, a mouth contact with a wound in a ritual practice is an unavoidable transmission factor. therefor, the fact that such transmission is an accident demonstrates that it is not malicious."
Attack,this is further evidenced by the fact a common reason used in defence of infant circumcision is aesthetic in nature.,"the aesthetic argument, while allegedly common, has not entered into this discussion thus far."
Support,"if this was the case, any of the psionics able people could have 'summoned' uap and recorded high quality footage. however, such that doesn't seem to exist. and the one attempt a team around barber made for doing exactly that failed with them apparently having only tried that once.",there are very high resolution cameras and similar instruments that could be used for this.

Attack,"politicians' speeches are also part of the public record. yet, there is no obligation for media to prominently show all of their speeches.","many tv networks directly broadcast donald trump's campaign rallies and daily briefings, largely unfiltered during prime time ."
Support,studies that have explored the high rate of suicide attempts among transgender youth have found that social support and community membership are protective factors against suicide.,"as friends and family are often the first to notice health problems in a loved one, greater support may facilitate early detection and management of life threatening illnesses, thus improving the longevity of transgender people."
Attack,the increase in interfaith marriages around the world in recent times suggests that interfaith couples are becoming increasingly accepted by communities all around the globe.,"this acceptance seems to primarily be in the west, rather than as a global phenomena."
Support,democratic governments rarely resort to using speech laws to restrict news sources for political gain.,governments often intimidate and pressure journalists to drop critical stories.
Support,the president's right to pardon is consistent with widely agreed upon international norms governing executive powers.,pardon powers are consistent with the executive branch's responsibility to carry out and enforce the law .

Attack,"buddhism and hinduism are incompatible, as they hold conflicting beliefs on the existence of an unchanging soul , which is a key concept in hinduism.",there is no indication that the buddha formally renounced hinduism ; it may be more accurate to consider him a reformer than the founder of a new religion.
Support,direct participation in international institutions increases palestine's lobbying power.,"if palestine was a member of the world bank, it could vote on the bank's executive directors, influencing projects carried out in the west bank and gaza."
Support,"refugees often attempt to cross an open sea by inflatable boat in numbers well over the vessel's safe maximum capacity with no life vests, meaning the risk of capsizing and then drowning is very high.","this happened in the widely circulated case of 3 year old alan kurdi who, along with members of his family, drowned while attempting to cross the mediterranean."

Attack,allowing the market to dictate how schools should be structured perpetuates the commercialization of education. this violates the notion that education is a human right .,"education is inherently a commercial undertaking, as students are regarded as commodities that ought to be trained into income generating instruments ."
Attack,"a genderless society would eliminate the element of choice that is created by the existence of gender categories. for example, there would no longer be men's clothes and women's clothes.","tags like women's and men's typically indicate other features; men's pants, for example, are more functional , while women's pants are more aesthetic. tagging products based on such features would maintain the element of choice, without needlessly gendering them."
Support,the teleological argument for god's existence as part of natural theology is not falsifiable. this is because there is no possible universe we could conceive of that would also rule out that a god made it.,"because god is mysterious and given excuses like a possible but undefined morally sufficient reason , even a universe consisting only of rocks or of one conscious being in perpetual agony could fit."
Support,its nature as a self inconsistent buzzword means that the conservatives do have a single consistent meaning for the word. that forms a fundamental part of this tactic.,something this undefined is innately harder to critique and analyse.

Attack,the meat lover's diet has the worst carbon footprint: about double the amount of a vegan diet.,transforming into a vegan diet may do very little to reduce climate change as business organisations may simply create artificial products for human consumption that may re enforce the issue of greenhouse gasses and pollution thereby re enforcing the issue of climate change rather than ending it and further adding to the poor diet in humans
Support,a parenting license would encourage responsible family planning.,parents are often unaware of how difficult it is to raise a child. the process of acquiring a license will allow potential parents to better assess whether they are actually ready for children or not.

Support,assigning a gender at birth can help some families effectively plan for the future.,"in societies like china , where having a boy is preferred over girls for the survival of the family, assigning gender is important."
Attack,"p1. the wording here is misleading. it is possible that a maximally great being exists could be read as it might be the case that such a being could, possibly, exist , or it's definitely possible that such a being could exist, whether or not they do in any particular universe. we don't know whether a maximally good being could exist in any universe that could exist, so we can't accept p1 even though it sounds like we can, due to the conflation.","there is no such conflation. p1 is clearly stating simply that it is possible that maximally great being exists. within the context of the argument, it doesn't make any sense to distinguish between levels of possibility. p1 is either true or false. a maximally great being is either possible or impossible."
Support,foodbanks can help provide for impoverished children who would otherwise not be fed.,foodbanks in the us feed more than 14 million children per year.
Support,the jehovah's witness practice of shunning is abusive and cult like.,"family members of the shunned do not acknowledge their existence anymore, and often completely cut off communication."

Attack,"reading novels for language learners can improve vocabulary skills, reading skills and writing skills.","novels could reinforce stereotypes and tropes, such as gendered notions of a damsel in distress and a knight in shining armor."
Attack,the argument is not about the media narrative. it is a general flaw and the public discourse is only shaped by the media. researchers and activists widely appear to have this same misconception.,"attacking the alleged tone of the media narrative to illustrate that a general flaw allegedly exists, in researchers and activists as well as the media... is still not attacking anyone's actual argument for ai existential risk, this point changes nothing."
Attack,some buddhist traditions teach that irrationality plays a central role in human creativity and place a high value on non dual mental states. this does not encourage critical thinking and reason.,the zen buddhist perspective on creativity is consistent with a modern psychological understanding of intuition p. 2 .
Attack,"even though internet platforms should not censor political viewpoints, they should be entitled to remove or label information that is known to be false.","internet platforms should not be allowed to label information as misleading, as doing so can have negative effects on the reader's political memory."
Attack,governments regularly use public schools to control the thinking of the next generation. private schools provide an alternative to this and a check against government power.,"private schools, like public ones, are at risk of controlling the thinking of students, as they are often owned by or run according to the wishes of a particular religion ."
Attack,smoking on planes was extremely widespread and has been successfully forbidden and eradicated in most major airlines.,banning smoking on planes is not comparable to banning cigarettes entirely.

Attack,"quantum supremacy has been achieved in computing. and therefore, exponential increases in computing power seem achievable in the very short term.","quantum computing is only appropriate for some computing applications , but not all of them. it is unclear if this approach would be adequate or helpful for agi."
Attack,"if that actually were the case, people wouldn't be eating meat.",increasing numbers of people are taking up vegetarianism and veganism.
Attack,"nationalism is a form of harmful social control, as it can shape the collective behavior of groups. we should not encourage nationalism.","the fact that nationalism can shape collective behaviour does not make it bad. shaping collective behaviour can be very good if it makes people more cooperative and willing to help each other, as nationalism does."
Attack,"monarchies are repositories of tradition and continuity in ever changing times. in the swiftly changing currents of politics, they help remind a country of what it represents and where it came from.","in france, the excesses of monarchy and the royal court contributed to the french revolution . symbolically, the revolutionaries sent louis xvi and marie antoinette to the guillotine."
Attack,"for many palestinians, israeli jobs are the only ones available to them. they provide much needed employment and considerably higher wages than palestinian jobs.","work permits are distributed arbitrarily ; young, unmarried palestinian men rarely receive one as they are deemed to be a security threat. this prevents full employment in palestine."
Support,many propaganda system do not give people an accurate view of the world.,there are powerful interests that find underfunded propaganda system to be easily bribed.
Attack,"according to non overlapping magisteria , science and religion concern fundamentally different aspects of human experience.",that science and religion concerns different aspects of experience does not entail that they are incompatible.
Attack,"there is no spatial limit to the diffusion of radioactive materials in the air, which allows particles to travel long distances and affect people half the planet away from the accident.","the more dangerous isotopes for humans are strontium 90 and cesium 137 , both of which have moderate half lives 30 years , and both of which are hazardous not because they are particularly radioactive, but because they both bioaccumulate in humans."
Attack,the spanish monarchy has been involved in a string of corruption scandals.,the fact that the spanish monarchy has been involved in a string of corruption scandals whereas several northern european monarchies have not suggests that monarchy is not the dependent variable in terms of varying corruption.
Support,"the us is a constitutional democracy or, more accurately, constitutional federal republic . the constitution upon which the state is founded gives the president the power to pardon.","other constitutional democracies around the world confer pardon powers on the president. abolishing the pardon power in the us would, therefore, violate this global norm."
Support,religion is the primary cause of conflict around the world.,religion has inspired many fundamentalist movements around the world that have caused conflict.

Attack,the fairtrade model doesn't encourage producers to focus on the quality of the goods they produce. making quality products creates better relationships with consumers.,fairtrade encourages farmers to reinvest the premiums they receive in incentives that will improve product quality and productivity.
Attack,"although extinction is a natural phenomenon, it occurs at a natural background rate of about one to five species per year. scientists estimate we're now losing species at up to 1,000 times the background rate.",extinction is hard to document as it s happening. that s why extinction rates are usually calculated with extrapolations and models. these models give wildly different numbers.
Attack,some philosophers have argued that abortion is wrong because it deprives an embryo of a valuable future.,"if this were true, then not fertilizing all eggs is depriving a potential human of a valuable future. however, it is not immoral for a woman not to fertilize all her eggs, or as many as possible. thus, the argument as given cannot be sound."
Support,"the claim that every worker has what they require to do the work they need to do ignores the fact that the need , in that case, is determined by the state rather than the worker and their potential customers.",the state dictating what workers need; is simply the new elite removing one of the last small straws of economic liberty the workers have. it is a step toward total abuse of the worker.
Support,"for those suffering from disease, health care is necessary to ensure survival.",those on round the clock life support need health care to continue living.
Support,star wars always used humor to flesh out major characters and important plot lines.,"when luke, han and chewbacca infiltrate the death star in a new hope to free leia, the heroism and drama of the scene are overshadowed by han's humorous and absurd banter with the guards over the intercom."
Support,"waste is fundamentally irrational and hence indicative of a less than perfect intelligence. if there are genuine instances of wastefulness, that would then show that the creator is not perfectly intelligent, and hence irreconcilable with the common theistic view of god.","waste is necessarily arbitrary: why x amount of waste instead of y amount instead? the only way around this is to have no waste at all, as 0 is unique and non arbitrary."
Attack,"many times, none of the options available to voters prioritize fighting climate change.","in the absence of ideal candidates, voters can force their ideas into policies through polls and protests."
Support,"symbolic significance: the pyramid symbolized the power and authority of the ruling class and their connection to the divine, which reinforced their legitimacy as rulers.","the pyramid was extremely big compared to other structures built during its time, people must have been impressed, humbled and proud to see the pyramid."
Support,"to prohibit a person, regardless of their occupation, from wearing religious icons is a simultaneous violation of the freedom of religion and freedom of speech.",major world powers agree that people should have the freedom to wear the religious symbols they please.
Support,the legalization of polygamy would present legal and procedural challenges for many countries.,"the majority of countries currently utilize a framework of legal union based on monogamous marriage p. 6 . many laws, such as those regarding divorce and inheritance, would need to be reviewed and changed."

Attack,zoos put humans at an increased risk of being harmed by wild animals.,"according to official data from the united states, the risk seems to be very low."
Attack,all memorials and monuments are historical works of art that add character and should never be removed. it's important for our children and newcomers to be able to study and view those works of art and learn about our history.,"the character of the monuments determine the values of the venue that hosts them. a monument in a city hall reflects the values of the city hall. a historical monument which does not reflect the values of the city hall would therefore be appropriate in a museum, or cultural center reflective of the values of the monument in question."
Attack,chatgpt is currently capable of programming some minor apps and games with little instruction.,it may have exceptional code training data for these particular apps and games.
Attack,"such a new system would not necessarily affect education levels, nor would it provide an incentive to teach civics to a larger portion of the population than is already the case.","there are already many civil society organisations, and social media influencers, whose focus is to spread political literacy. the more that's at stake, the more people want to inform and be informed."

Attack,jesus was jewish and claimed to be the fulfillment of jewish law .,"christianity as a distinct religion is based more upon the doctrines of paul of tarsus , who traveled throughout the roman empire spreading his version of the faith, than it is upon the teachings of jesus."
Attack,non fictional war movies generally follow different dramatic patterns to fictional sci fi fantasy. reactive characters heighten the harrowing and paralyzing chaos of war. many would argue this tone is not as appropriate in a more optimistic series like star wars.,"star wars, as a series, is at its best when it is borrowing dramatic patterns from other genres. the borrowing of a style from a war movie is no different to borrowing from westerns in the case of han solo, from 1950s screwball comedy for much of the empire strikes back's scenes with han and leia, or from silent movie stars like buster keaton for the never enjoyable antics of jar jar binks."
Attack,most mainstream media outlets attempt to responsibly mitigate islamophobia.,"mainstream, right leaning news sources in the us and the uk regularly disseminate highly and negatively skewed coverage about muslims."
Support,propaganda does not need to be true to be effective some people will believe propaganda that plays into their own biases without verifying whether it is has any factual basis.,"like many issues, the revision of history or even current events sometimes called alternative history and alternative news is used to fit things to a particular false world view."

Attack,increasing the minimum wage would reduce income inequality better than a salary cap would.,"the value of the minimum wage has declined by 24 since 1968. state mandated adjustments for inflation have proven insufficient. by contrast, executives keep their salaries inflation adjusted."
Attack,the former director of the nonpartisan congressional budget office estimates that the green new deal could cost as much as 93 trillion .,"this cost is spread out over a nine year period , meaning the costs to the taxpayer are less drastic."
Attack,shinto has increasingly moved beyond being an exclusively japanese phenomena and has embraced the development of online communities .,most traditional shinto sects have expressly disavowed online communities .
Support,"most major problems would be solved if everyone recognized them as such, and knew how they worked and what basic steps to take to work towards solving them. good epistemic habits would usually cause all of this.",a populace being made up of people with good epistemic habits allows for the consistent proliferation of important information and exclusion of unimportant information.
Support,it is unlikely that the bible has retained its original form.,the text of the old testament existed as stories that were passed down through generations before being molded together by authors and then later edited into book form. it is unlikely that these were accurately transmitted before being assembled.
Support,"students will be more engaged in school if they can see a clear purpose to what they are learning, that is, if they are aware that the skills they are being taught will help them get a job.","if students get into the habit of paying attention and working hard in vocational classes such as coding, they are more likely to carry this attitude with them into other subjects, and improve academically across the board."
Support,"couples, especially women, may be ostracized by their friends and family if they marry someone of a different faith.","in a survey, nearly all jewish parents in israel expressed extreme discomfort with the possibility of their children marrying out of judaism."
Attack,"people and cultures generally resist change, particularly when it is as significant as transhumanism.","it's means, rather than appeal, that creates survival. thus, people may end up pushing past their disliking for change and instead embrace it if surviving means more to them than abiding by their aversion to it."

Attack,reverse flash is one of the most iconic and unique supervillains of all time.,the reverse flash is nothing more than the opposite of the flash.
Support,sometimes true equality must go beyond technically equal and give protections to one sex or gender that the other simply does not need.,"abortion being banned technically gives equal rights to both genders. but since men can't get pregnant, such a law hurts women disproportionately, so it is discriminatory in practice. that is why feminism must go beyond technical equality under the law."
Attack,"currently, as only those who cannot afford private education attend public schools, they are unlikely to be able to complain and bring attention to inadequate schooling.","people of parenting age are often politically engaged p. 19 , which increases the attention paid to education ."
Support,"a large majority of meat eaters either have a pet, want one or watch cute cat videos with an aww type of reaction. that again shows the fact that we have the innate ability to think compassionately about animals and not think of them as supper.","it also shows, once again, that we are irrationally biased towards certain animals."
Attack,moral or immoral are subjective judgments. something could be called moral or immoral depending on the point of view.,see 1.1.4.2.10.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.4.1.1.1.1.1.

Support,"ufos could be explained by reasons that go far beyond our comprehension, but since we do not have all the knowledge , no available option to us could explain it.",there are still plenty of phenomena that humans have not been able to explain.
Support,"to claim that a scientific paradigm is political is to apply a political label, after the fact, to a scientific position that has been formed following objective consideration of facts and evidence.","it was only through the research of scholars, like proponents of critical theory , that we learned that scientific paradigms do have political meaning."
Attack,"the bible condemns deuteronomy 12:31 , 18:10 , 2 kings 21:6 , jeremiah 7:31 and permits genesis 22:2 , judges 11:30 31, 39 human sacrifice.",jephthah may not have actually vowed to kill his daughter .

Attack,"teaching religion accurately and in context is very hard to do, given that most people have some bias on this subject.","while teaching is hard in general, the challenges of bias can be addressed by propperly funding, training, and supporting teachers."
Support,mars colonization provides a chance to learn from mistakes of the past and do come up with better ways.,people could make efforts to keep the environment intact when they migrate there.
Support,there is a stereotype that people with mental health issues cannot recover .,research shows that 25 65 of people with a serious mental illness are able to make a full clinical recovery . this means they are able to live a satisfying life even with ongoing limitations caused by their mental illness.
Support,"even with vaccines, 100 protection from either the flu or covid 19 is not guaranteed.",even those who are vaccinated can spread the virus.
Support,carbon offsets can mitigate your impact without having to make lifestyle changes.,"the cost of carbon offsetting per household is low enough that almost all people, including minimum wage employees and social security beneficiaries, should be able to afford it."
Support,"pain, suffering and unhappiness are too broad to act as definitions of evil. to define evil this way is to trivialize and misconstrue evil.",any definition of evil is highly subjective to the individual defining it and their preconcieved moral values.
Support,"an author or creator must be allowed a monopoly over their creations , which might not be possible in the absence of speech restrictions.",limitless freedom of speech would prevent authors from censoring the unauthorized reproduction of their intellectual property .
Attack,fraudulent speech should be prohibited due to the material harm it can cause.,"most lawsuits for fraudulent speech, like slander and defamation, fail ."
Attack,the fermi paradox concludes human's specialness in the universe.,the fermi paradox raises an open ended question about why humanity hasn't long made public contact with aliens or found clear proof of their existence it is only one potential conclusion that humans are special.
Attack,"generally, people are self interested, and so value not being oppressed. a logical person will try to prevent their neighbor from being oppressed so that they will return the favor.",people's self interest does not have a great track record in preventing oppression.
Attack,devotion to individual freedom leads to a lack of cohesion within society.,societal cohesion has little worth if it is used to make people miserable.
Attack,"some people would contend that whenever a minority disagrees with a majority, it is incumbent upon the minority to show why the majority is wrong. since atheism is a minority , it would be up to them to offer justification.","the lack of belief in any claim god or otherwise is inherently justified until sufficient evidence is presented to prove said claim is true. otherwise, if claims are to be accepted without any evidence, any claim no matter how ludicrous can be accepted as true, which cannot be the case."
Attack,"a majority of americans are in favor of capital punishment, and their opinions should be reflected in the law.","the law should reflect the will of the people, but the will of the people should itself reflect what is just and moral. whether or not the death penalty is just and moral is precisely the point in question."
Attack,"many cuisines, such as in persian or hindu , do have restrictions on which meat to eat and still enjoy a rich culture. phasing out meat would work similarly.","geographical differences in cuisine developed in part because of the availability of particular game and types of grasses . thus, cultural patterns describing the phasing out of meat are not reproducible in other societies."
Attack,"unlike politics, the aim of science is neither influence nor control.",a lot of scientific research is funded for the precise purpose of influencing consumer behaviour.
Attack,"capitalism is the result of private property and free association. capitalism cannot be suppressed without suppressing either one of these, which would be either impractical or against the rights and liberties of the people.","the rights are a manufactured product of a society and are reflection of a society's values system, which comprehends the economic structure . so, the argument is circular."
Attack,"in case of religiously motivated circumcision, it is unacceptable for the parents to leave a permanent, lifelong sign of their own religious affiliation on the child's body.","all parents pass on their beliefs to their children psychologically, whether intentionally or not. circumcision is a minor matter in comparison."
Attack,taxation is theft because it involves the appropriation of a citizen's wealth and prevents them from using their wealth as they freely choose.,"taxation is payment for society as a service, it is not appropriation."
Attack,the right to self defense is a natural law as it derives from the right to self preservation which existed in a pre political state of nature.,"neither life not self defense are inalienable one can be deprived of either, and people often are . thus, they cannot be inalienable rights."
Attack,gender specific art has a right to exist . ensuring gender equality in video games limits creativity and denies access to gender specific art.,"the existing delineation between girl games and boy games isolates women from being able to access the latter, which are considered to be mainstream video gaming. therefore, gender specific video games are still likely to benefit men more than women."
Attack,taxes on meat would not resolve the problems associated with its production and consumption.,a tax for tobacco significantly reduced its consumption.
Support,"as technology is developing, the ability to track bitcoin has also been advancing.",ciphertrace has been successful in tracking bitcoin payments to off shore cryptocurrency exchanges in the past.
Attack,"the maximum carrying capacity of the earth is around 10 billion , which will be reached by 2100. to be able to provide food for such a large global population, everyone would have to give up meat.",estimates in the cited article assume that food can be grown only on arable land; recent advances in hydroponics and the potential to use other biomes as sources of food have not been considered in the estimation procedure pp. 58 59 .
Attack,"the parent reveals its presupposition in the statement, reality is real and contrasting this with the supernatural is real. this reveals a clear bias for calling the natural world real without providing any evidence for this. this is the matter at hand! it is taken on faith that the natural world is real! this is appropriate for this belief is properly basic as is belief in the supernatural.",the quote reality is real is in a sentence saying faith in reality being real would be necessary meaning it does not presuppose that. it is simply stating that if it must be faith for the scientist to believe that the physical world is real the theist must have double the faith for they must believe both in the physical world and in the supernatural one. the parent is taking things out of context and misconstruing the meaning.
Attack,the state commonly limits certain types of self expression if they are likely to cause harm to individuals or society.,"the american medical association ama has urged lawmakers not to restrict minors' access to gender affirming surgeries if they need it, as it a doctor's ethical duty to provide care for a patient undergoing a normal expression of human behavior."
Support,children may experience uniquely negative effects from growing up in polygamous families.,it is mostly religious families that live in polygamous families.
Attack,"such a law would just compel people to refer to others accurately, rather than forcing them to commit actions they do not want to do.","the way a private citizen wants to be referred to is not regulated by public institutions in any other case. therefore, the regulation of pronoun usage is not covered by any restriction, nor any freedom."
Attack,modern advertising allows for massive free services.,"it is not free, users pay for the service through paying for the advertised product."
Support,female soldiers could be assaulted in war by both allies and enemies.,rape has been used as a weapon of war throughout history.
Support,"if sexual orientation were a choice, being subjected to conversion therapy would surely encourage people to choose to be straight.",conversion therapy is demonstrably incapable of altering sexual orientation without causing harm.
Attack,backroom deals would favor the status quo over the people.,"retaining the potential for backroom deals is important, because it gives fptp politicians a reason to support or at least not oppose asset."
Attack,many businesses have received threats from people who believed in fake news.,"the blame is on those actually making the threats, not on those merely believing in the fake news, even less on the fake news articles and writers themselves."
Attack,"people have seen theophanies , or visible manifestations of god, but not his true form.","if jesus is god, then seeing jesus would be in some meaningful sense the same as seeing god. people have seen jesus, so people have seen god, in some meaningful sense."
Support,"the near space region, where surveillance balloons operate, is poorly defined in international law and lacks a comprehensive legal framework.","increased activity in the upper atmosphere has raised new jurisdictional questions regarding access, security, and environmental concerns p. 2 ."
Attack,we should not disadvantage citizens of poor countries even further by restricting their travel based on the very fact that they are from a poor country.,"citizens of unfortunate countries have a strong incentive to stay in wealthy countries; therefore, wealthy countries should have the means to regulate the influx of visitors from these countries."
Attack,"interpreting the word as a verb is highly dubious. the verb root is alleged to be krh, but this root doesn't have an aleph, unlike the word in question. nowhere else is this verb form used in the hebrew bible. thus, while the reading as like lions may be odd, it is at least a well attested hebrew form.","even if there is a difference in vowel pointings between the two words, this could easily be a copyist error because the points are small and easy to miss."
Support,"truth may not be philosophically objective, depending on one's school of thought, but one can admit the existence of facts based on enough evidence.","most judicial systems work on the assumption of the existence of objective truth, without which the exercise of law becomes impossible."
Attack,"theists believe in god while atheists do not. just as the burden of proof falls on those who assert the existence of a particular god, it also falls on those who assert that there is no god whatsoever. the true claim that the five senses cannot indicate the existence of god is a justification for agnosticism, not atheism.","sagan standard . extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. science fortifies the evidence of absence of supernatural causes, thus making the absence claim not extraordinary."
Support,there is more to being a good pope than theological rights and wrongs.,a good pope must also keep the church relevant and stay connected to congregants.
Attack,there is no reason a traveler from the tribe of judah couldn't have moved to nazareth at some point.,"if place of birth were not important, the gospels of luke and mark wouldn't go to such efforts to make jesus seem to be from bethlehem."
Support,"voters can use randomness coins, dice, computers, etc to work around the problem of a coarse ballot if the number of voters is large.",party officials can do the random process and distribute the results to loyal adherents.
Support,the bible makes several factually contradictory claims.,"the bible claims simultaneously that men were created before birds , and that birds were created before men ."
Support,"given how controversial anti fake news legislation would be, the process would likely take a long time in most democracies.",this process would likely increase polarization and further reduce citizens' trust in their government.
Attack,the jewish understanding of the creation narrative supports the theory of evolution p. 4 .,"traditional jews rely on a literal reading of the torah and reject the theory of evolution, considering it opposed to their faith."
Attack,"the gospel accounts, just like other historical documents, bear no special burden of proof. there are good reasons to think the gospels are reliable until proven wrong.","since the gospels allege events that violate universally observed natural laws , they bear a profound burden of proof; namely, to prove that the alleged miracles are more likely to be true than that the testimony itself is wrong."
Support,countries with government run health care systems tend to spend less on their health care.,the u.s. lags behind other developed countries in health outcomes despite spending more per capita on healthcare primarily due to lack of access to affordable care .
Attack,children should be taught religions or popular beliefs to see which one they believe.,"religious beliefs tend to be part of the cultural identity of a country, therefore it is unlikely that children would choose a different belief."
Support,there are medical and cosmetic interventions approved by parents which are permanent and which carry the risk of any medical intervention.,"from piercings to vaccines to remediating a tongue tie, parents choose paths for the child without asking permission from the infant. their reasoning ranges from cosmetic to dealing with non life threatening issues but it is the parents' decision as to what is important enough to do."
Support,"science and religion are complementary approaches to the search for truth and the nature of the universe. where science is the search for observable truth, religion is the search for moral and philosophical truth.","science is an important structured way of thinking that helps us consolidate the human race's knowledge through a framework, but it has its limits. religions give us access to spirituality, which is the only known tool to fill in where science can't explain things. thus, religion and science are compatible."
Support,"president trump spent minimal time doing his job, giving the impression of laziness.",president trump spent the majority of his working hours in the vaguely titled and unstructured executive time .
Support,tiktok has robust mechanisms that help identify and combat misinformation.,"tiktok has employed specialized moderators to detect, identify, and remove content intended to mislead users."
Attack,"it is clearly immoral to forcefully impose religious practices on adults who do not consent to participating in those practices. since small children are incapable of offering consent, it is similarly immoral to impose religious practices on small children.","there is a difference between actively withholding consent in the case of the adults , and simply being unable to make a decision either way in the case of small children . imposing religious beliefs in the first case is much worse than in the second case."
Attack,"many jobs can already be automated by adapting current technologies, with many more on the horizon .","we are very far from a world without need for human labor . there are many problems that can only be addressed by humans in healthcare, childcare, eldercare, cleaning the environment, etc."
Attack,there are also some atheists who would not be considered moral by standards of fellow atheists . this means atheism in and of itself does not make someone moral or immoral.,this does not disprove the parent or make it less valid in any way. the fact that there are some atheists that might be considered immoral does not mean there cannot be at the same time some atheist that could be considered moral
Support,"the surveillance balloons most likely to pose a threat to the privacy of citizens are those operated by the government, which is unlikely to effectively monitor and regulate itself.",domestic surveillance programs suffer from a chronic lack of oversight .
Support,students at nevermore academy possess supernatural traits which makes the story more exciting.,shows like wednesday help quell people's fascination with the supernatural.
Support,there is no way to accurately assess a person's parenting capabilities.,"the most important metrics for such a test would be subjective, which means they cannot be accurately assessed."
Support,"not all actions need to be about achieving acceptance. it's legitimate for lgbtq safe spaces to just exist, regardless of whether they work toward achieving any social or political aims.",focusing all lgbtq social spaces on activism could lead to burnout by placing people under constant stress and giving them little reward for their work in return p. 11 .
Attack,"child labour laws and water quality laws do exist in many countries already, so that we don't have these laws is wrong.","the point is not about whether or not such laws exist. the point is about whether they are a effective and b sufficient as well as c on the global level which is directly connected with local regions with better protection due to imports and various pressures, most notably market pressures."
Attack,objectivity can be approximated to certain degrees.,"true objectivity in the sense that everything is absolute and the same path is chosen every time towards infinity, is impossible. human nature and our reality does not allow objectivity."
Support,linking rights to intelligence has been used historically to justify discrimination and thus should be avoided.,"iq tests have a long history of racial biases, and these biased tests have been used to prop up scientific racism ."
Attack,"if this was the case, joseph wouldn't have much reason to keep this a secret once rumors got out of a resurrection.",christianity was a pretty small sect early on. it's possible joseph of arimathea simply never heard much about the early christians and so didn't have any reason to publicize that he moved the body.
Attack,"turkey and the eu are important strategic allies geopolitically, both in need of each other.",the eu and turkey no longer have a common geopolitical orientation. the long standing republican tradition of turkey established by atatürk has shifted towards a theocracy under the rule of erdoğan and is no longer compatible with the liberal democratic orientation of the eu.
Support,"gender neutral bathrooms promote equality in how society values time and allocates resources. in the long term, greater gender equality may discourage the sexualization and dehumanisation that fuels violence towards women.","policy decisions are often based off of perceived need and moral legitimacy . thus, increasing the perceived equality of women may increase their share of public resources."
Support,as a k1 society we can finally start exploring space properly within our solar system.,the next step to our evolution as a species is to colonise space and spread our civilisation to our galaxy and beyond. globalisation is the natural evolutionary process that takes humans to that state of becoming a type i civilisation.

Attack,having sex without emotional attachment reduces the pressure to find a permanent romantic partner.,"for society as a whole, this is problematic since children are usually produced in committed relationships."
Support,schools are uniquely equipped to mitigate and counteract the adverse consequences of coming out.,"schools have a responsibility to hold parents accountable for the well being of their students and to ensure that their developmental needs are being met. topics related to parental bigotry could, therefore, be covered through programs such as parent teacher meetings."
Attack,"death is the primary tool of evolution. to eliminate death for some arbitrary individuals is to eliminate evolution for the species, effectively condemning mankind as a whole to stagnation and obsolescence.","it is possible that enough people would refuse immortality as to allow a natural evolution of the human species to continue in parallel. if humans develop immortality however, this too is part of evolution."
Attack,"donald trump has reduced the efficiency of the mailing system usps to help prevent the election , thus indicating his ability to use resources effectively.","doing this also can harm other important legal services too, even if trump wishes to stay in office."
Support,publicly asking a stranger for sex is appropriate in particular circumstances.,"women positively respond to being approached for sex when the sex is likely to be pleasant, safe, and will not negatively impact their reputation."
Attack,"there has been no legislative sponsorship for the statue, which is required by law.",requiring legislative sponsorship gives the government the power to decide which religions are acceptable in society.
Attack,christianity makes unrealistic demands of its followers.,"no one is forced to follow christianity; people voluntarily choose to follow it and embrace its demands, however unrealistic they may seem to others."
Attack,"islamic scripture states that women s sexual pleasure is both acceptable and natural, and that husbands and wives should care about one another s sexual pleasure.",there is no prescribed punishment in islam for men who do not fulfill their wives' sexual pleasure.
Attack,"globally, a third of women will experience sexual violence in their lifetime, and 80 will experience sexual harassment. this is an existential crisis of security half of the world population is facing every day. we ought to alleviate this suffering as soon as possible.","sexual harassment doesn't usually kill people, especially when defined broadly enough to describe something 80 of women experience. in a debate that includes actual existential risks like nuclear war, pandemics, or misaligned agi, applying the label existential is a distraction above and beyond merely being false."
Support,"once hacking back is legal, the technology is likely to develop and improve so that it is possible to respond to thenumerous attacks made against corporate entities.",improvements on a larger scale will also make it possible for smaller businesses to protect their interests by incorporating the technology into their practices.
Support,"the bible doesn't make the claim that the canaanites were wiped out, and it indicates that the canaanites lived right into the new testament.",deuteronomy 7 refers to a command for the israelites to wipe out the canaanites. it doesn't refer to the israelites actually successfully doing so.

Attack,"most people are not accustomed to applying sunblock to their genitals, and may forget or be uncomfortable doing so.",nudists accustomed to applying sunblock would be unlikely to forget to apply it to their most sensitive areas.
Attack,it is immoral to create and control sentient life.,"agi could solve ethical and philosophical dilemmas better than humans, including issues created by agi as well as the issues that humanity has faced for millennia."
Attack,"in the book the dual soul connection: the alien agenda for human advancement suzy hansen describes being brought by the beings to their craft to pilot it, 2 she used her mind to operate it. dr. schild that co authored the book said that the beings could be using a kind of quantum communication technology that connects to the human mind and that communication device has a map of the entire reality.","there is no reason to think that a they indeed use quantum based communication technology rather than just it appearing like so or them making people think that b that assuming they have such a map, it's an accurate map of entire reality and humans also have maps of the observable universe or c that any of this would support the claim above."
Support,the eu is one of the most politically stable regions in the world.,the democratic nature of eu member states reduces internal conflicts and promotes stability.
Support,the long term financial benefits of mandatory schooling far outweigh the costs to the state; investment in education can provide infinite economic return .,the switch to compulsory education is associated with national economic improvement.
Support,"the ability to collaborate and debate the wording mentioned in the top post will mitigate the risk of one side hijacking the forum, and enacting archaic and draconian laws.",a forum that put reasons to agree and disagree on the same page would encourage moderation.
Attack,the majority of well known religions are exploited by people seeking wealth and power.,that powerful people exploit their power for personal gain is a slight on human nature and not religion.
Support,one's social environment causes obesity and often cannot be influenced.,childhood experiences beyond one's control lead to obesity.
Attack,minors may not be equipped to deal with the rigorous or painful aftercare associated with gender affirming surgeries.,"many conditions require children to undergo surgery that requires intensive aftercare e.g., colectomy ; healthcare staff guide both children and parents to facilitate this process. gender affirming surgery is no different in this regard."
Attack,"since, as of 2019, low income individuals in the us only make up 10.5 of the population , planned parenthood only benefits a minority.",health care costs in the us are regressive . households with incomes in the bottom 20 are paying the highest portion 33.9 of their income for health care.
Attack,"when one accepts a role in government, they voluntarily consent to limit their speech for the greater good of the nation as a whole.",the legal basis for forcing federal employees to contractually limit their first amendment rights is dubious at best.
Attack,"without other policies, a ubi alone would not be able to address the structural and socio economic causes of inequality.","this is an over simplification. when you have not enough money to make it through the month, your position is much more desperate that when you don't have money for leisure. to deny this basic comfort on the base of relative wealth is to forget that there is more similarity of experiences between poor people everywhere in the world than within the steps of a single social pyramid."
Support,a 2013 colorado survey found that 45 percent of latinos in the us rely on home remedies to avoid medical costs. this is likely to increase as a result of privatization.,"latinos, particularly those from indigenous backgrounds, have an established history of using natural medicine.the community uses these medicines for a wide variety of health issues including stomachaches, headaches, muscle pain, anxiety, and even birth control and abortion."
Attack,hebrews 11:3 correctly teaches that the what is seen was made from what is unseen . this evocation of invisible elements strongly points at molecular building blocks that couldn't have been know by the sciences of the 1st century.,air is an invisible part of the natural universe that would have been well known to the new testament authors.
Support,"in single sex schools, students can harass same sex peers.","same sex harassment can be fueled by homophobia or transphobia . specifically, students may harass those who do not conform to cisheteronormative norms and expectations."
Support,"in many instances, palestinians do not have legal title to the land.",land outside cities often don't have land titles . this makes palestinian land outside of cities an easy target for settlement expansions.
Support,"the core tenets of the christian religion that use the belief, trust, and faith definitions of the word pistis are restricted, in the gospels, to belief in the truth of the words that jesus said and, in the epistles, to belief in the identity of jesus as god and what logically follows, his resurrection from death.","the possibility that jesus is god or that he rose from the dead are not capable of being explored by science, and thus don't contradict science."
Support,it is not the role of a national government to maintain the stability of international financial markets at its own expense.,"nation states are accountable to their own people, not to those of other nations."
Support,"people will have a hard time viewing certain physical characteristics, like breasts, as androgynous.","due to anatomical sex differences, men and women have different needs; for example, within the domain of sports, men need groin guards , and women need sports bras . in a genderless society, these accommodations would not exist."
Support,internet platforms are bad at choosing what speech to remove or demote.,"what constitutes a 'fact' in politics is often determined more by dominant social beliefs , rather than academic consensus. therefore, any attempt to fact check politicians will come off as partisan or incorrect."
Attack,"the construction of these memorials are done to put forward ideologies. for example the individuals are posed heroically, with positive messages.","monuments do not signify the enduring morality of the subject, but celebrate an aspect of their character within the context. sometimes monuments celebrate nothing except a person's importance to history, good or bad."

Attack,the only choices are the universe had a beginning and the universe did not have a beginning. they had a 50 50 chance of getting it right so the fact that they did is not surprising.,"theories of the big crunch and an eternal universe would give at least 2 more choices, and if we believe hawking's defense against fine tuning, there are infinite universes out there, meaning that while we exist the probability that would not have existed was 99.999 . so while it is not surprising to find that we do in fact exist, when given infinite possibilities, objectively speaking we should be extremely surprised."
Support,"many methods of self powered transportation, such as bicycling and walking , also provide good exercise and positively impact physical and mental health.",people who commute by bike are more productive and take fewer sick days than those who drive.
Attack,"marriage is a historical institution and tradition. marriage today cannot be entirely detached from its sexist historical social meaning precisely because people largely continue to enter into marriage for symbolic reasons rather than due its practical benefits chambers, pp. 4 5 .","there are other formerly unjust institutions which, although they can be entered into for symbolic reasons, seem to have shed their oppressive meaning. for example, citizenship in the us has historically been a racist and sexist institution, being defined in a way that excluded blacks and women. us citizenship has been redefined and no longer seems to have a racist and sexist social meaning brake, p. 120 ."
Support,there would still be competition for prestige and recognition.,people would compete for reputation rather than materialistic wealth.
Support,"many people are against genetically modified food. where they constitute a significant public opposition, this should be reflected accordingly in the law.",numerous ethical concerns surrounding the genetic modification of animals have led animal welfare groups to oppose this.
Attack,"the role of the state is to ensure that all of its citizens can live comfortably. if public nudity impedes general comfort, it can and should be banned.","in some situations, widespread public nudity could make people feel safe in the knowledge that no one has any concealed weapons, increasing their comfort."
Attack,"just because refugees come from different countries doesn't mean they cannot integrate. given time and assistance, anyone can learn how best to live in a new society. also, with young children refugees, they still have a lot of time to learn language and culture in schools.","muslims tend to believe that living best in a new western society is under sharia law. see: 1 , 2 , 3 and 4 ."
Attack,"this is indicative of a social problem within gaming communities, rather than one related to the games themselves.",empirical findings support the link between video games and sexist behavior.
Attack,the movie delves much deeper into the philosophical side of the force than the rest of the star wars movies.,"the force is not philosophical in this movie, it's just space magic. in fact, it goes out of its way to both tell and show us that the philosophy is irrelevant; the original jedi texts are destroyed because rey already knows what they have to teach."
Attack,"film producers are focusing more and more on chinese marketing, seeming to indicate that this does not hurt their incomes enough to merit consideration.","film makers are focusing on china in order to tap into its large market of legitimate moviegoers, and is not a tacit support of copyright infringement."

Attack,"bathroom bills like hb2 in north carolina, and a similar proposal in texas , were introduced in 2017 to prevent sexual predators from accessing women only spaces by claiming to identify as trans women.",hb2 and the similar proposal in texas were created in bad faith as attempts to prevent transgender people from using the bathrooms that correspond to their gender identity.
Attack,"mother teresa is a symbol of racism, of a white woman swooping in to rescue people of color.","in luke 10:25 37 , jesus tells the story of the good samaritan, to encourage followers to help one another, regardless of racial differences. mother teresa's work is, therefore, consistent with this teaching."

Attack,the fear of judgement and consequences provides incentives for good behavior.,"virtue consists, not in abstaining from vice, but in not desiring it. abstaining from something wrong because there will be negative consequences, as opposed to because it's wrong in and of itself, is not moral."
Attack,"in the aftermath of the 2004 boxing day tsunami, many survivors thought they saw the ghosts of the drowned wandering the beaches, due to local beliefs that the spirit of a dead person will appear if their body isn t disposed of with proper funeral customs .","this case proves that people can hallucinate ghosts of deceased loved ones, but not that they can have hallucinations they believe are of a physical person. the witnesses to jesus's appearances believed he was physical luke 24:39 ."
Attack,"it would be a blessing, not a curse, to rely on the government in hard times.",relying on the government for financial assistance could hurt the pride of those who like to project themselves as economically privileged and independent.
Attack,female priests would not be effective icons because they would present as an unattainable level of authority for most women in church.,the value of being allowed to become priests goes beyond occupying the role and into being seen as worthy of the office.
Attack,"there is a higher correlation between unemployment and crime than between income level and crime hooge et al, 2011 .",unemployment leads to crime due to economic desperation and alienation. a wealthy unemployed person is not likely to commit crimes.
Support,"any benefit to us arab relations would be negligible at best and at worst it would be seen as a betrayal of one of their key regional allies, israel.","israel's enemies around the world including hamas and the pa will not be pacified by recognition, or even the creation of a palestinian state only by the destruction of the jewish one."

Attack,female circumcision is different from male circumcision because the intention is to suppress female sexual arousal .,"it can be just the opposite. ispub.com the fact that some communities that practice this, believe it enhances sexual pleasure opposes the claim that it is done with the intent to suppress sexual arousal. whether it actually does or not and for how many is immaterial."
Support,"it is hard to see why this would be the case. governments would have to deal directly with goods of value rather than money, and when money is not available to determine accurate prices, there is more room for error exploitation by misrepresenting an item s value.","additionally, the value of an item is entirely dependent upon the needs and desires of the owner and the potential buyer recipient at the moment of the transaction. this is one of the main reasons money as a concept developed to allow efficient trading in goods and services. barter is inherently unstable as a way of measuring value."
Attack,existing systems and processes are not sufficient to address major issues facing humanity.,existing systems and processes could be improved without global governance for example through international blocs or international networks and so on.
Attack,"a number of man made famines have occurred as a result of capitalist states seeking to control other governments and their economies. therefore, private ownership of capital does not necessarily prevent human atrocities either.",capitalist states have also helped equip governments with famine management processes.

Support,it would be impossible to have a global set of laws that every religious group found acceptable. constructing and implementing global policies would therefore likely spark religious unrest and violence.,"many countries differ in the provision of holidays for religious festivals and events. because the one world state would have to choose between the holidays it grants, due to practical reasons, this might cause disputes and protests."
Attack,religion allows societies to feel hope and to see light in the most darkest periods.,"some of the happiest and most peaceful countries are also some of the least religious. in 2012, the top 4 happiest nations, denmark, norway, sweden, and the netherlands were also ranked as the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th least religious countries. psychologytoday.com"

Attack,"most modern conflicts are intra state conflicts; inter state conflicts are very rare. thus, moving to a one world state would not eliminate most conflicts.",there is research suggesting that conventional warfare between nations is likely and an increasing possibility in the coming years.

Support,the current push for people to publicly disclose everything about themselves or for people to dig into private lives and share personal info publicly is unhealthy. perhaps this might be considered some degree of forced disclosure that is done in the name of authenticity.,"social media companies have a considerable interest in promoting the tendency for people to disclose their personal information, as this information is crucial to maintain their business models ."
Support,social media tends to be used less for educational purposes and more for entertainment.,humans tend to overuse social media to fight boredom and loneliness instead of finding something educational and or fulfilling.
Support,with the advent of the marvel film franchises marvel's characters are arguably more well known.,marvel has 8 characters in the top 10 of the most popular superheroes.
Attack,"capitalism, more than any other system put into thought or action, helps the poor.","over the last few decades, china's planned economy is what has brought the most people out of acute poverty."
Attack,"this is an argument for companies to increase their in house pay transparency policies, rather than to make all information publicly accessible.",companies have a vested interest in keeping pay as low as possible; the only way they would make the requisite pay transparency policies is if they are required to.
Support,gerd lüdemann's hallucination hypothesis is false .,"the evidence we do have suggests that lüdemann's psychoanalysis of peter and paul is mistaken. in the first place, lüdemann's imaginative reconstruction of peter's emotional state following his denials and jesus's crucifixion fails to diagnose correctly the true problem peter faced. it was not so much that he had failed his lord as that his lord had failed him! lüdemann thus fails to enter into the mindset of a first century jew who had been following a failed messianic pretender."
Attack,it is irrelevant how things can be labelled. that is essentially an ad hominem.,"denying the label of leftist, and saying that whether the label applies is irrelevant, are different positions. switching to defending one after the latter is defeated is fallacious."
Attack,licensing could discriminate against single parents.,children of single parents are at a disadvantage ; therefore creating a policy resulting in fewer single people becoming parents would be justified.
Support,"when workers in a company know what everyone is paid, it improves the workers' trust in the company.","according to a survey of 70,000 employees, the more workers knew about the reasons behind their pay grade, the less likely they were to quit."
Attack,studies have linked heme iron found in red meat with an increased risk of colon and rectal cancer . vegetarian sources of iron like leafy greens and beans contain non heme iron .,"studies on the effects of red meat intake do not account for the differences in processed and un processed meat, which is unacceptable because the two have vastly different effects."
Support,"gender is an important aspect of one's identity . as transitioning enables self expression for many, the state should not be able to limit minors' access to gender affirming surgery.",the social and cultural nature of gender influences people's social networks and relationships. it would be problematic for the state to have a say over this.
Attack,muslims tend to use violence to defend their beliefs when they are the majority.,during 'umar's caliphate the dhimmis religious minorities in the islamic state had full religious freedom and civil liberties. they had the full right of practicing their own religious rituals and rights.
Attack,cis women could be placed at additional risk in women only spaces due to the inclusion of trans women.,exclusion by cis women poses a much more serious threat to the health and safety of trans women than the inclusion of trans women poses to cis women.
Attack,"normalizing public nudity would lead to a reduced need for clothing, which would benefit the environment.","ethical consumerism is about prioritizing goods that are ethically sourced, made, and distributed. reducing the production of clothes will not necessarily promote these practices."
Attack,"many firms hire former hackers to stress test their systems. perhaps some information will leak, but firms will be able to constantly update their systems to ensure those leaks cause little harm.","if encryption keys leak, then companies would have to create a new key and repeat the process."
Support,cattle mutilations have occurred over many decades and so far the cause has not been identified while the case for aliens being behind it becomes ever stronger even when that sounds absurd and bizarre.,there is no blood around the cows even when it is done outdoors and the dead cow is detected shortly after its death. since this didn't happen just once but consistently many times that excludes explanations like some wild animals doing that and no human technology that can do so is known either.
Attack,breastfeeding is impractical if mothers return to work.,pumps can be used to get milk in advance for when the mother is regularly away from the baby.
Attack,promoting a two state solution by recognizing palestine would repeat what has failed in the past and foreclose other more viable options.,"israel can refuse to return to negotiations, despite strong international pressure, as it perceives us support as unconditional; us recognition of palestine might counter this belief."
Attack,granting agi rights would make the risk of a rebellion worse by granting agi unprecedented social and political power and status.,risk can only be a justification for refusing rights if that risk is greater than the risk of refusing those rights. there is no reason to assume that granting fundamental rights to agi poses such a risk.
Attack,there have been widespread claims of ritual abuse of children by satanists.,satanism expressly commands its adherents to not harm children .
Support,"turkey is in an excellent position to engage in further trade with the middle east, which is expected to become an extremely profitable market pg.37 .",turkey's trade with the middle east reached 56.4 billion in 2017.
Attack,"by restricting the ability of unsuitable individuals to conceive to begin with, parenting licenses allow for earlier state control than current child protection processes and, by extension, keep more children out of state care. this is in the best interests of both child and parent s , as well as society.","a license is only able to screen people beforehand, not act as an intervention agent after a person has a license. rather than preventing abuse, it simply prevents able prospective parents from procreating."
Support,"in secular countries, governments and politicians should try to advocate for their views without relying upon religion.",the democratic value of letting the best argument win can be overruled by religious arguments leading to less optimal outcomes for the people.
Attack,king charles' unpopularity with the british public renders him an unsuitable choice for the throne.,popularity can be gained over time; it is not necessary for king charles to have begun his reign with immense popularity.
Attack,"dress codes also enforce stereotypes and dress codes , and even without mandatory uniforms schools are likely to enforce some type of dress code.",school uniforms can prevent unequal enforcement of dress codes by mandating all people to wear a uniform and removing the grey area for enforcement between girls and boys.
Attack,money laundering may go undetected in the absence of border control.,a universal currency gets rid of currencies that do not have strong protective mechanisms in place such as holograms or scanning protections . this makes money laundering overall harder.

Attack,"the earth will continue to exist by the time humans have gone extinct. once humans are gone, the earth will heal itself and new species will evolve.",human beings have caused such extensive damage to the planet and other living things that the possibility exists that nothing will be able to heal even if human beings go extinct.

Support,"cinderella is outdated in its portrayal of various female protagonists, and as such should not be promoted as a good fantasy story.","cinderella relies on her prince to save her. this reinforces the idea that women need protecting and 'saving', and that the people who are capable of being protectors are men. that idea does not fit well with modern ideals of feminism and gender equality."

Support,working over 39 hours a week was shown to have negative effects on mental health .,increasing time away from work has been shown to reduce stress .
Attack,"revelation 7:4 supports the jehovah's witness doctrine of the 144,000 .","revelation 7:4 and revelation 14:1 5 describe the 144,000 as from the tribes of israel, virgins, blameless, and having jesus's name and his father s name written on their foreheads. it is inconsistent to ignore these restrictions on who is in the 144,000 while taking the number itself so literally. however, a literal understanding of the number 144,000 is required for the jehovah's witness doctrine built around this number to work."
Attack,"older people are more likely to be conservative in their views. while it is the 21st century, it is not unreasonable for a pope born before world war two to have 20th century values.","by this logic, it would be excusable for the church to always stay several decades, if not an entire century, behind ongoing societal change across the world."
Attack,there is no way to eliminate brain injury from the sport because there is no way to prevent harm inside the skull.,"saying that any possibility of harm to the skull must be removed is an unnecessarily high burden. by this logic, injury and risk is inherent to many activities and sports and all ought be banned. clearly this is not the case."

Attack,it is our biological directive to preserve our own species at any cost.,this only concerns human life in general as if this debate was largely referring to human life as a species. however it's likely irrelevant in regards of comparisons or similar between individual humans and animals as in is saving the life of a human more important than saving the life of an animal? .
Attack,not including trans women in women only spaces would set a bad precedent for how people should be treated in gendered spaces.,"given that women only and men only spaces are wholly separate, it is unlikely that the rules of one will determine the rules of the other."
Attack,"this could be because children of gay parents were more comfortable coming out, not because more of the children were actually gay.",the difference in orientation was so large that this would be unlikely.
Support,"on matters pertaining to reproductive rights, including abortion and contraception , mother teresa held views that were in line with those of the catholic church.","mother teresa opened several orphanages to care for destitute and dying children. the fact that she opposed abortion and contraception, despite seeing their plight, testifies to the strength of her convictions."
Attack,"being consistent to the degree that an axiomatic system in mathematics is, is not a common criteria for objectivity.",a moral system should not contain logical contradictions. e.g. there should not be any circumstances under which a moral system says you are required to do x and you are required not to do x .

Attack,to judge what is unnecessary pain requires an omnipotent understanding of what is ultimately necessary. but this would only be possible in the presence of an omnipotent being.,"there is a difference between logical necessity, which may require an omniscient perspective, and the necessary restrictions imposed by one's composition."
Support,"this assumes humans to be totally rational beings, dispassionately weighing the options.","homicides are often crimes of passion , and therefore insusceptible to rational deterrence."
Support,god gives our lives meaning. he created us for a purpose.,"belief in some deity ies, along with the belief that they care about our existence, provides the basis for meaning that is not based in simple human self service, or the pursuit of the next dopamine release."
Attack,open source software could have intentional vulnerabilities in the code.,open source development usually involves the same process of reviewing the code before merging as closed source projects.
Attack,design argument 2.0 fuz rana's design argument 2.0 updated watchmaker argument,"the watch maker argument fails by suggesting that humans can tell the difference between designed and non designed objects, while simultaneously suggesting that there are no non designed objects."
Support,political and economic differences mean that a global currency could create tension between states.,political and economic disagreements often lead to tension between states.
Support,"censoring controversial and offensive speech can be useful in preventing negative, regressive cultural change.","throughout history, culturally regressive groups have used clearly identifiable and highly offensive symbols in their media."
Support,farming animals has severe impacts on the local environment due to its heavy resource use and impact upon the landscape.,the production of meat consumes disproportionately more resources than the production of crops.
Support,"when a third party manipulates or prevents trade by hindering what can be bought or sold, dictating prices, requiring a specific medium of exchange , it causes persistent distortions in the market, moving prices to non equilibrium levels, and preventing equality.","the profit motive incentivizes third party manipulation of trade where profitable, ensuring the prevention of equality."

Attack,new atheism attacks the controversial standard of morality preached by religions instead of theism as a whole. it seeks to bring attention to the practices and beliefs of religion which go against universally accepted scientific truths.,"this approach does not, in itself, present a standard by which one can determine whether or not the proofs of theism either general or specific are sufficient."
Support,"where a society accepts corporal punishment, there is collective consent, which makes it acceptable.","this is no different from national laws on punishment, which are similarly created and justified by the social contract."
Attack,"there is no significant evidence that people had to travel thousands of kilometers to return to their ancestral home and no evidence that the legions, governors or other prestigious figures did such.","there is no evidence that people were asked to travel thousands of kilometers, only that joseph felt obliged by the edict to return to bethlehem."
Support,"the passenger density of cars is very low. this contributes to congestion and poor traffic flow, and represents an inefficient use of space.","in addition to the size of a car itself, moving cars require a great deal of additional space between them p. 1 ."
Attack,rey has even interpreted as fitting the archetype of mary sue: a character who is idealized and strong in ways that are unreasonable or unfitting.,"the mary sue archetype is sexist , as is its application to rey as a character."
Support,"according to the humane society of the united states, petting zoos with wild and domestic animals on display for visitors to touch need special consideration. more than 75 zoonotic diseases can be transmitted from animals to people, many without direct physical contact, including rabies, salmonellosis, toxoplasmosis, and e. coli. children, pregnant women, and the elderly are especially at risk.",typically zoos cannot vaccinate wild animals against these diseases because vaccines developed for domestic animals have not been proven to be effective on wild animals.
Support,engagement and working hard in school is not simply a function of whether or not pupils are gaining marketable skills: it is the result of cultural factors which teaching coding will not change.,"pupil engagement is not determined by the subjects being taught, but rather by the influence of their peers . if a student sees their classmates listening and paying attention, then they will too. if, conversely, they see disruptive behaviour, they will imitate that instead."
Attack,meat effectively delivers important nutrients for humans.,vegetarians vegans generally consume a diet consisting of less saturated fat and cholesterol than the average meat eater.

Support,"calls for a two state solution were significantly weakened in 2021, with a shift amongst experts towards believing a one state solution is likely .","as of early 2021, palestinians in the gaza strip had begun to indicate a preference for a prioritisation of their economy over political nationhood."
Attack,"even if we were to take for granted that there are things which are objectively good or bad, there is no objective basis for the claim that that we ought to do that which is good and ought not to do that which is bad.","this claim is contradictory because it presumes that objectivity is good, but also that the objectivity of what's good cannot be established."
Support,there are other problems that already are a menace to humankind and we do nothing about them.,"there should be a more efficient wealth distributive system, and yet humanity does not work to achieve this."
Attack,"while that may possibly be true, being useful while also causing extinction is unlikely to be seen as beneficial on collective levels. concerning defectors, there can be measures to prevent such and even if those fail, an ai that only requires to be installed on systems or readily available systems is unlikely to also be very powerful or as powerful as necessary in this context.","in context a pro supporting a claim about ai that feigns being helpful and harmless , being useful while also causing extinction is not the trade off that any but the most concerned critics will see in the ai in question."
Support,"the authoritarian extremists, in an established anarchist territory, would be out numbered by extreme anarchists not to be confused with anarchist extremists .","the anarchists radicals will be prepared, drilling, and vigilant, it will be their pride and joy for many of them, analogous and possibly superior to current forms of nationalistic militia activism not including the cultural, legal, and military modifiers in effect, which vastly reduce militia activity ."
Attack,"making art and music are expressive activities that depend on the abilities of the artist to create something new, which necessitates free will.","human and primate art has been linked with the evolutionary pressure to attract a mate, meaning that it could the result of a biological impulse rather than a free expression."
Attack,"boycotts are peaceful, so that stakeholders can make their opinions felt while minimising the escalation of tensions.","the call for boycotts have been accompanied by inflammatory remarks , suggestions , and actions ."

Attack,the age of exploration was endorsed and funded as a way for countries to gain an advantage over their competitors.,"the age of exploration, as the driver of centuries of intercontinental slave trade and the pillaging of resources by european colonisers, may be alternatively viewed as a reason not to encourage international competition."

Support,civil disobedience usually oversimplifies a given problem and or chooses the wrong subject to be elevated into the spotlight.,"for example, rather than putting a particular company's misconduct into the spotlight, it may be more appropriate to put a lack of policy that prevents companies to not break human rights into the spotlight of public attention."
Support,using a method that isn't able to prove or disprove something's existence isn't of a justification to believe or not believe in that something.,"one cannot use the scientific method to measure metaphysical ideas. using science to understand religion is like using chemistry to prove the meaning of art, or physics to prove the concept of love."
Support,professional football players are very well compensated for their participation and are not compelled to remain football players.,"the median salary of an nfl player is around 860,000."
Attack,"at marine boot camp, 3 out of 4 women fail to meet combat standards . this suggests that women are not as capable as men in this regard.","after training , women recruits were able to meet the same combat standards as men."
Support,"according to research, male characters were more likely than females to engage in physical aggression 52 and 32 , respectively . this reinforces the stereotype that aggressiveness is predominantly a masculine trait and that men are more physically aggressive than women p.16 .","female characters were more than twice as likely as males to share and help 32 vs. 15 of males , and four times as likely to be nurturing 8 vs. 2 of males . this further reinforces the idea that women are caregivers or nurturers p.16 ."

Support,a diverse global market can increase sales potential.,"a culturally diverse organisation will have a broader voice, reaching a diverse network of clients."
Attack,"exposure to controversial topics and opinions supports the development of critical thinking and helps children make up their own minds rather than blindly following the status quo pp. 56, 57 .","children are often strongly influenced by their teachers and may abandon their own critical thinking efforts to agree with them. as this could threaten a child's religious or social upbringing, parents should be able to refuse to send them to school."

Support,"though they may be a burden initially, most children eventually become adults who contribute to society and bear those burdens as a net benefit to society. these individuals make sure that both the aging and next generation after them are supported.","by not having children, the world is deprived of all the good that the child could have done."
Support,religion incentivizes people to become morally better.,religions teach humility and honesty to individuals.
Attack,"hatred is only perceived as such due to the war. had the war not happened, and the secession gone clean cut for everyone, the idea of hatred might not have subsisted more than a couple of years","one may argue that confederate monuments embody hate as they promote the message that some humans are inferior and should be treated as property, regardless of the war."
Attack,"palestinians seek recognition to access the right to self determination. yet, self determination is not a tangible element of international law p. 3 . the us, therefore, makes no difference by refusing to recognise the state.","the principle of self determination has historical precedent and has been invoked on many occasions, dating back to wwii."
Attack,the increasing cost of elections in australia can be tied to its implementation of mandatory voting.,the relatively high cost of elections in australia is likely due to the fact that australia holds elections more frequently than other comparable democracies.
Attack,"political correctness does not stop hate speech. at best it prompts the hateful to show fake politeness, and so encourages two faced behaviour rather than decent behaviour.",overt politeness even when insincere is more decent than overt hate speech.
Attack,bare skin to grass contact brings a number of health benefits to the human body. laying naked in the grass likely increases these benefits across the entire body.,"depending on the absorption rate, being naked may not bring any additional health benefits beyond standing barefoot, which one can practice without full nudity."
Attack,the foster care system is not a safe or positive environment for children to be in.,"while the foster care system may not be perfect, it is a place of safety necessary for many children who need to be removed from dangerous situations."

Attack,phoenix has two of the strongest powers: telepathy and telekinesis.,the scarlet witch is proficient in chaos magick and can therefore alter the phoenix's ability to use these powers.

Attack,many political systems are currently limited in their ability to take significant action. those in power benefit from the status quo and fighting climate change decreases their profits.,"in order to meet long term goals of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, nations can set interim goals that are easier to achieve. this was done in the paris agreement ."
Attack,"like certain protections against verbal harassment are specific to traditionally oppressed groups, like racial or religious slurs, it's reasonable to provide similar protections to transgender individuals who have endured historical verbal abuse.","the gender binary is a biological absolute: one can only be male or female. therefore, gender identity cannot be conceived of as an objective characteristic."
Attack,tax evasion strategies and other loopholes are rampant among top companies in the u.s. this is made even worse by lobbying and special interest groups.,this is an argument against the us fiscal and political system and not against capitalism per se.
Attack,"the new trilogy's biggest strength is the chemistry between the new cast of characters, and the last jedi takes them all away from each other for effectively the entire very long film.","by separating rey and finn, we got to see rey and kylo's chemistry, which is a very strong and rewarding new element that wasn't given enough screen time in the force awakens."
Support,"the word from in from the dust is actually not in the original text . thus, genesis 2:7 could be interpreted as describing metaphorically what man is, not what he came from.",the same form is used in exodus 8:16 without the idea of from.
Support,the shared values of catholic teachings can provide a more stable and nurturing environment than the potential variability in parental guidance.,the sense of belonging within a catholic community provides a strong support system . shared values like charity and communal responsibility encourage members to support each other in times of need.
Attack,"if the objective is to reduce bullying, education should focus on teaching acceptance and tolerance of those different from us. it is unclear why the lgbtq community should receive special treatment out of all of the children that are bullied.",a class on acceptance of the lgbtq community does not deter one from giving other classes on acceptance of other communities.
Support,the statues can be kept without glorifying what they once stood for. they can be kept in museums with proper historical context rather than on a plinth to be admired.,"placing the items in a museum acknowledges our past, but takes step forward in removing a historical conscience collective of whiteness as social norm."

Support,agriculture currently uses 37 of land mass globally and vertical farming can lower that percentage.,"for many reasons , the world's available farmland is ever decreasing, yet we will need more in the future for a growing population . vertical farming increases the yield per acreage to allow more people to eat on less of land directly on earth's surface through stacking ."

Support,not all israelis demand that palestine recognises israel as jewish.,"haredi jews, who make up 10 of israel's population, are oftentimes violently opposed to the idea of a jewish state."
Attack,limiting reproduction based on genetics might overlook potential contributions or unique strengths these individuals could offer society.,"there are over 8 billion human lives so one could consider the life of any other human as the life more valuable than the never existing life. reproduction will not come to an end just because a few people with major genetic disorders don't reproduce. this would probably be a good argument if the world population wasn't too large after an exponential recent growth but having great capacity, and maybe a need, for more humans."
Attack,the state would be too large to be governed effectively.,"many extremely large states, like china or india, are governed fairly effectively. there is no reason to think that effective governance of 1.4 billion people is feasible, but the effective governance of 7.7 billion people is impossible."
Support,governments come and go but the monarchy remains constant. the continuity a sovereign brings to their country ensures stability through a single figure.,constitutional monarchy is an effective system of government as it avoids the requirement of republics to appoint a president or leader on a regular cycle.
Attack,ai will lead to cost savings in the creative sector.,the technology used in making ai art would be expensive.
Attack,"god didn't need to create us. thus, his choice to do so was fundamentally arbitrary and so our existence would still be meaningless.","only if god needed to create mankind, could we consider that our creation is fundamentally arbitrary because out of necessity many things are done that are fundamentally arbitrary. but, because god didn't need to create us, and instead chose to do so, implies some act of will. a willful act will always be more meaningful than one made out necessity."
Attack,many lgbtq people will act straight so they are not attacked for being flamboyant ; gay bars are critical safe spaces for expressing authentic behaviours without hatred.,"straight people are not solely responsible for homophobic attacks on flamboyant gay boys and men. indeed, non flamboyant gay men have been known to invalidate their peers' experiences ."
Attack,"sikhism relies on one primary text, the guru granth sahib , for spiritual and doctrinal authority.","the guru granth sahib is a compilation of devotional writings, poetry, and hymns rather than a document that establishes the authority of the sikh faith."
Attack,"the harmful riots on the 6th of january were based on a lie repeated by donald trump, that he had won the election.","while they may have repeated trump's line on the election, many of them were motivated by qanon conspiracy theories and the subculture surrounding them."

Attack,"early christians say that jesus rising from the tomb on the third day is predicted by scripture. if they believed it was predicted by scripture, as the scripture predates jesus, they would have predicted jesus would rise from the dead even before he did.","assuming you mean the scriptures containing prophecy that predates jesus, luke 18:34 informed us that the disciples did not understand any of this. its meaning was hidden from them, and they did not know what he was talking about. so if that is true, it would be more than reasonable to prepare a dead jesus for a tomb in the manner that they did."

Attack,"what is civilized and acceptable in public discourse is fluid and changes geographically, by group, by topic. there s no way to have a universal political correctness .","the idea of political correctness is not a fixed set of rules, but a continuously developing consensus of what is offensive and what isn't. although people might disagree on the details, most people in one country culture could name something that is generally viewed as improper or hateful to say in their particular culture."

Attack,erecting additional monuments next to existing ones which honor the victims and tell their stories will add to the historical content.,"in practice, this rarely, if ever, occurs and is impossible in many situations."
Attack,this argument employs the fallacy of composition ; the reasons for which gender neutral bathrooms work in some locations may not apply universally.,"the argument may be logically unsound, but it is consistent with policymaking conventions. specifically, policies are tested on a small scale and, subsequently, scaled up, if the preliminary results are positive p. 1 ."
Support,orbital rings are not beneficial for people on earth.,"orbital rings might be block the visibility of night sky, which would be bad for on earth astronomical observations"
Support,both the afghanistan and pakistan governments have welcomed chinese mediation ; they view the chinese government as a neutral and trustworthy third party that can help bridge the gap between the two states.,"it was at beijing's request that pakistan and afghanistan established a crisis management mechanism which would enable the two sides to maintain timely and effective communications in case of any emergencies, including terrorist attacks."

Attack,"a universal language would threaten linguistics and cultural diversity, eradicating the benefits of the latter.","the question doesn't ask to do away with other languages in favor of a universal one. other languages may still be learned and cultural diversity can be preserved. this is demonstrated wonderfully in many countries where the country has a national language, but other languages still flourish us, canada, india, etc."
Attack,"while the violence inflicted upon each gender is disproportionate, feminism suppresses the fact that men suffer more violence and injurious accidents.","feminists do not suppress statistics about men having more injurious accidents. feminists have a strong history of union participation, and unions have a strong history of striking for less dangerous work ."
Attack,using a bar as a platform to empower a community often leads to exclusion; it is better for lgbtq activism if gay bars are simply treated as bars.,"gay bars are not the only places that the lgbtq community can meet in. disempowerment would not be a concern, if these spaces were to close or become more accepting of straight people."
Attack,"access is not the definitive issue with this point. time, which is a key ingredient in forming reasonable opinions, on the scale that would be required is simply not available to your average voter.","crowd sourced forums overcome time commitment problems of individual users by letting them participate on their own time and in their own space. this feature of online collaboration make it so individual participants don't have to carry as much weight, or spend as much time, individually."

Attack,"lying to an employee by terminating employment, citing other reasons when mental health was their true objection, is an offence as it falls under discrimination laws . therefore, employers are unlikely to take this kind of action as employees should be and are able to sue in such cases.",under many legislative regimes the onus is on the employee to prove that they have been subject to discrimination which may be difficult.
Support,"better computing capacity allows us to calculate more complex models with more variables. in the future, we may be more able to take preventive action to halt or limit climate damage, including against adverse weather events .","sophisticated modelling has helped to develop plans for longer term climate action, making it easier for people to visualise the necessary steps for change."

Support,greater freedom of sexuality normalises diverse sexual identities.,diversity of sexuality increases tolerance towards minorities.
Support,"when rights clash, we typically make ethical decisions on the basis of which right is quantitatively less harmed, independent of what those rights are.",many countries restrict choice by placing sin taxes on or outright banning harmful products. these are justified by the greater harm imposed on the health of individuals who consume them.
Support,"unlike wild animals, farmed animals are born explicitly due to human action. while we may have a duty to ensure that their lives are not unnecessarily cruel, it is not immoral to kill them for our own ends given they would not have existed otherwise.","as long as these animals are given a reasonable quality of life, it is preferable that they get the opportunity to exist given to them by humans for the purpose of farming. in the alternative, many animals do not get to exist at all."
Support,religion helps people come together in order to create networks or long lasting relationships.,most religions hold peace and tolerance as core values and promote love and respect towards others.

Attack,"an elective monarchy has existed in poland , where the monarch was chosen by a body called the sejm .",the elective monarchy used in poland was not democratic in the modern sense. only members of the nobility were able to vote for the king.
Support,the citizens of rich countries should not have to pay for the development of poor countries.,"even if rich countries gave poor countries funds as compensation for the damage caused by climate change, there is little accountability for poor countries to use the funds responsibly."

Support,man has a sensus divinitatis sense of divinity that grounds justifies belief in god by the appropriate circumstances making it properly basic. plantinga speaks of sensus divinitatis as a disposition or set of dispositions to form theistic beliefs in various circumstances or stimuli that trigger the working of this sense of divinity.,"just as perceptual beliefs like there is a tree are not based on arguments from more basic beliefs but arise spontaneously in me when in the circumstances of a tree s appearing to be there, so the belief god exists arises spontaneously when in appropriate circumstances, such as moments of guilt, gratitude, or awe at nature s grandeur, as a result of the working of the sensus divinitatis."
Attack,multiplayer video games are social activities that often involve cooperating with others online or in person.,"when gaming with consoles, most people will only have a small number of controllers, meaning only two or three people can play at once."
Support,"businesses may lose customers who wish to have segregated bathrooms. if the decision was mandated by law, these customers would have nowhere else to go and would be compelled to accept the change.","boycotts are often short lived momentary expressions of outrage ; long term boycotts require finding a new establishment and are, therefore, too inconvenient for patrons. thus, the net effect of boycotts is unlikely to be significant."
Attack,jesus' reluctance to be seen clearly by his followers immediately after the crucifixion makes sense if he merely survived and needed to find out which of his followers he could trust and which would hand him back to the authorities. hence his behaviour on the road to emmaus listening and finding out what they thought then disappearing. if he had had supernatural insight he would have already known who he could trust,"if jesus did survive the crucifixion, he probably would have been in noticeably bad shape when he met the disciples on the road to emmaus just a few days after his crucifixion luke 24:13 35 . however, they don't seem to notice anything unusual about jesus."
Attack,technology has removed many of the historical barriers to women being employed and deployed in the military,warfare requires certain tempermental proclivities such as ability to shut off empathy and lower amygdala distress which men are better suited for evolutionarily.
Attack,science is based on assumptions that cannot be objectively confirmed.,the basic assumptions of science can and have been tested and are no longer considered controversial issues .
Attack,professions and skills that are most in demand today may not be the same as those in demand tomorrow.,"while this is true, it remains unsubstantiated why coding in particular would be a skill and profession not in high demand tomorrow instead in contrast to the many claims of it being a 21st century skill ."
Attack,any project requiring many lifetimes would be achievable by an individual.,"we have seen the end of very long projects that we didn't start, it is hardly emotional . even if you were to start them yourself, they would still be finite. you would be infinite."
Attack,"the united nations considers western countries to have the happiest residents, with northern european countries being at the top of the list.","the world happiness report refers to these countries in the context of nordic exceptionalism , implying that their high ranks in the report should not be interpreted as representative of western culture."
Support,fruits and vegetables produced through hydroponic methods are less tasty than when grown in natural soil.,"most nutrient solution fertilizers only contain npk . we do not know enough about what influence trace elements, microbial soil life and mycorrhizal funghi have on taste and nutritional value to truly replicate the tastes of conventional conditions, or at least do it consistently."
Support,porn may deepen your desire not to have sex due to the fact that it might be portrayed in a repulsive manner in some media.,"excessive exposure to graphic or violent sexual content can desensitize individuals , making them less responsive to the idea of real world sexual intimacy."
Support,god may exist but his existence may not be knowable or inferable.,man often without proof considers himself made in god s image apparently biasedly using himself as reference for judging god attributing to god human qualities. but god could be mentally physically so different inhuman that he could not be recognized knowable if visible.
Attack,"according to holism where actions should be viewed as wholes , the ends could justify the means.","breaking actions down into parts can make it easier to understand each individual action, as each may have its own reason."
Support,students whose parents pay for their tuition are still capable of working hard. only poor students that pay for their own loans would have to handle the additional financial burden.,poorer students are already expected to work harder due to often coming from a non academic environment.
Support,"like beggars, many workers are exploited by their jobs.","in countries where unionization has increased, it has been severely repressed by the government, therefore forcing people to pick between working on low wages or not working at all and falling into poverty."
Attack,"men tend to be physically stronger than women, and strength is accordingly considered a masculine gender attribute. this biological difference explains why men hold more power than women.",men are not categorically stronger than women; there are many domains of physical performance in which women outperform men.
Attack,"abortion and feticide were common practices in biblical times. if this were morally wrong, there would be an explicit prohibition against this act; the fact that this does not exist implies that abortion has no moral significance.",common practices do not determine biblical claims to morality because common practices represent opposing view points from opposing cultures. this includes primative cultures that did not have words to explicitly identify or translate to our english word abortion.
Support,"banning private schools could put stress on the economy as millions of children would have to be accommodated for in state schools, or supported within former private schools, with no increase in funding to allow this.","reducing the number of students that attend state schools can increase the amount of funding available per student, as the tax base remains the same but funds are distributed between fewer students."
Support,"satanism may be more normal than other religions, if its beliefs are more consistent with the values of modern democracy e.g., equality, liberty . in this regard, traditional religions are regressive and should be de emphasized.","modern satanist branches include some modern liberal stances such as pro choice , freedom of speech, and sex positivity ."
Attack,"if superintelligent agi was referring also to extraterrestrial agis, then it or these could have exterminated humanity long ago. it thus seems unlikely that this would be in its or their interests.",it could be that only some superintelligent agis are not largely congruent with human values or potential values in the broader sense of alignment.
Attack,"it is necessary for progress to contest issues that were previously uncontested. for example, slavery was itself uncontested for a long time.",slavery has been a part of almost every culture's past . establishing a clear line on what is acceptable in history is difficult as both sides always have positive and bad elements on their legacies.
Support,it may be unethical and or prohibited by space laws to disturb or significantly affect the natural development of a civilization.,contact may more often be detrimental to either or both sides and is hence prohibited.
Attack,"having no experience with loved ones dying through aging to teach us the grief process, violent accidental deaths will take a heavier toll on living peoples' psyches.",violent accidental deaths could still happen early in a person's life.
Attack,"president trump repeatedly attacked the department of justice, seeming to prefer defending political allies over allowing a department headed by his own attorney general to follow its course.","the doj is part of the executive branch , so it is right and proper for the president to ensure it is following the right course, and to criticize it when it fails to live up to his standards."

Attack,"humans are the kings of the animal kingdom, they have mastered and beaten all other animals using weapons, traps and intellect and are thus worth more than all the other animals.",the us is by far the most militarily powerful nation in the world. this does not imply that americans are more morally worthy than people of other nationalities.
Support,pregnancy and motherhood have a substantial negative impact on one s career pp. 4 5 .,"a study at cornell university found that being a mother is a clear disadvantage when applying for jobs. mothers face a wage penalty of around 11,000 compared to their childless peers p. 1316 ."
Support,humans are hard wired to take certain physical cues as an invitation to approach someone sexually. it may be beneficial to embrace these.,the use of nonverbal proceptive behaviors generally makes someone of another gender more attractive which may motivate someone to approach a stranger for sex.
Support,"future people have no ability to advocate for themselves. as such, governments should act in such a way that maximises their future choices. this is not possible in a world with rampant global warming.","behind a veil of ignorance , people would generally agree that it is good to limit suffering and allow people the autonomy to live a good life. this is limited by climate change so people should act against it."
Attack,men's sexual and reproductive health needs are often prioritised over women's.,men's infertility is often ignored as reproduction is seen to be a woman's duty. this causes distress and hinders care.
Attack,the idea of being merely exalted is very different from having the fullness of deity dwell in oneself.,this depends on the specific unpacking of exaltation and fullness of deity dwelling within . these two are by no means very different .
Support,"buddhist schools defined various levels of ignorance , teaching that, by cutting off increasingly deeper levels of ignorance, one can gradually gain understanding of the true aspect of existence and finally escape suffering.","in zen buddhism , ignorance is the fundamental state of human perception and understanding."
Support,repatriation detracts from the diverse and cosmopolitan nature of museums and galleries worldwide.,diversity can still be achieved without state ownership of the artwork.
Support,many people are forced to beg due to structural economic causes such as intergenerational poverty and caste systems.,a ban on begging wouldn't stop it if there are no alternatives to survive. the root cause is poverty and this should be solved first.
Attack,the government has sufficient data on citizens' income and spending and should therefore be able to work with other experts to develop a tax that reduces waste without negatively impacting access to water.,"while sufficient data is available, often forces in the government end up being harmfully biased , so minorities may face harsher water taxes than the top 10 ."
Support,"psalm 2:7 literally says ... today i have begotten you , which could refer to the incarnation.",the word for begotten in psalm 2:7 just means bear or sire in the sense of bearing a child.
Attack,"many disciples would have had to have the same or very similar grief hallucinations, which is unlikely.","they need not have been more similar than involving jesus: from the experience of jesus, the explanation would then be that he rose from the dead."
Attack,"paul is using natural and spiritual to describe the orientation of the body toward god, not whether the body is physical. in 1 corinthians 2:14 15 the spiritual man is called spiritual not because he lacks physical form, but because he is godly.","paul describes the resurrection body as different from the corpse as a plant is from the seed it grows from, and distinct from the sown corpse. the dead body is perishable, of dust, weak, dishonorable; the raised body is imperishable, of heaven, powerful, glorious."
Support,the batman metal comics are one of dc's much more darker turns to the dc multiverse.,the batmobeast is a monster truck with batman's evil soul .
Attack,children's discomfort with those of other genders is not natural but rather an issue of education and socialization. it is likely to diminish with time and use of gender neutral bathrooms.,"children do not fear strangers indiscriminately; instead, they learn to fear strangers, particularly men, who pose threats to their safety. thus, because stranger danger is real, fearing strangers serves an adaptive purpose."
Attack,qi is a concept that has been recognized in traditional chinese medicine tcm for thousands of years.,"the efficacy, reliability, and ethics of tcm are debatable ."
Support,"healthy, natural foods are often significantly more expensive than cheap, processed foods.",an analysis of various studies conducted in high income countries concluded that a healthy diet is on average about 1.50 more expensive per day than an unhealthy diet. this equals an extra cost of about 550 per person per year.
Support,learning a language helps people understand the cultural traditions of that language's speakers.,languages are often intertwined with the culture of those who speak it.

Support,nuclear power plants could become target for attacks by air.,"ballistic missiles could hit a power plant, sending radioactive material into the air."
Attack,"with psychological manipulation, there is no easier and comparably effective alternative to learning about the relevant areas of human psychology. thus people intending to harmfully manipulate people will learn about it, unofficially or officially. long term there is little difference, they will largely know the same things either way just as well.",this claim is false and has no supporting source or data. people are not widely learning about psychology to better manipulate their x twitter followers to which they post misinformation that they themselves often believe for example.
Support,many publishers claim the current rules give artists unjustly small amounts of control over their work and thus should be changed.,many publishers have argued that they should retain control over works for longer periods of time.
Attack,"religion, as a required course, improves the moral values of students.",religious instruction does not make pupils more moral than those without religious instruction.
Support,"due to israel's reliance on american support for equipping its military, it is unlikely that israel would endanger this support by going against its supplier's interests.",the us also provides vital defense technologies that israel would not have access to otherwise.
Support,"rather than repeat the same debate like in reddit's change my view, kialo's debates are usually just added to by interested persons.",continued growth and polish of existing debates feels like lots of work and an accomplishment and dissuades users from starting duplicates.
Attack,president trump's statements frequently displayed arrogance.,many of president trump's supporters claimed that the us needed an arrogant president .
Attack,voter fraud occurred with regards to voter registration.,"while some outlets claimed that more people voted in wisconsin than were registered, this claim was proven untrue."

Attack,many of the political promises that president trump made failed to manifest into reality.,president trump delivered on his promise to cut as many as 70 of us federal regulations if elected .

Attack,the hbo reboot would be good for harry potter fans .,"the harry potter movies are still firmly lodged in the public consciousness, to the point where a tv series feels unnecessary."
Attack,"if everyone used others' preferred pronouns, those who wish to use different ones would feel less pressured to come out and explain their identity to everyone and more confident in openly expressing it.","such a practice may make it harder for gender non conforming people to simply 'pass', instead forcing them to hint at their gender identity to everyone they interact with."
Support,justification for atheism depends on 1 the probability that god would leave more evidence of his existence than what we have and 2 the probability that we have comprehensively surveyed the field for evidence of his existence. thus the atheist must bear the very considerable burden of proof for 1 and 2 .,"michael scriven maintained that in the absence of evidence rendering the existence of some entity probable, we are justified in believing that it does not exist provided that 1 it is not something that might leave no traces and 2 we have comprehensively surveyed the area where the evidence would be found if the entity existed."
Attack,"in some areas of the world, it is highly important for citizens to have their religious beliefs represented in the laws of their country. in such areas, the implementation of global policies at odds with their beliefs could therefore be met by severe public outcry.","enshrining religious beliefs in law tends to result in the oppression of religious and other minorities, which causes conflict, so the removal of religious laws might actually reduce the incidence of conflict."
Attack,"the methodology used to compute the pay gap metric is flawed, as income distributions are not gaussian . the median wage should be used instead.","faulty methodologies yield faulty metrics. however, the gender pay gap metric fluctuates in accordance with the expected outcomes of corrective interventions, such as pay gap reporting requirements ."
Attack,this can be negated by a process through which the government purchases the artwork for a fair price.,"to many owners, artwork could have more than just monetary value, including cultural, historical, and sentimental significance. money cannot adequately compensate for this."
Attack,"education, especially that of children, needs a human touch.","education is primarily about the acquisition of knowledge and skills, which do not require a human touch."
Attack,sexual orientation does not have to be assumed. it might be sufficient to hang a sign that says lgbtq people only and expect most patrons to comply.,the defiant few who do not comply with an explicitly stated lgbtq only policy may be the very people such a policy seeks to exclude.

Support,"if one argues a study is free of bias because it was peer reviewed, it also requires one demonstrates the integrity of that peer review process. other wise it is reasonable to point out the flaws in the peer review process and reasonably assume the subject study was susceptible to those flaws.","peer review is not perfect means to control bias and conflict of interest in science. the peer review process is susceptible to a lack of transparency, and objective review. and prone to editors and reviewers with bias. so the effectiveness of a peer review must be transparently demonstrated, not simply claimed to have occurred."
Support,in isolation an end can never truly justify the means in all cases. in civilised society time and again we attempt to restrict means by which ends are acceptably accomplished e.g. murder and war crimes being prominent examples.,discussion about the eventuality of some event is a preferable method to discover all the motives at work.
Attack,nature will automatically take care of population growth once the carrying capacity of earth is reached.,approaching the carrying capacity of the earth will come at a tremendous cost to life on the planet and threaten the existence of many animal species.

Attack,"no matter how people feel about scientific facts or what they think ought to be done with them, facts cannot be changed to suit our feelings or our aims.",facts can be derived to suit feelings or aims. charles murray and richard herrnstein's infamous book the bell curve offers as fact a description of racial difference in terms of iq.

Attack,"male circumcision has health benefits, whereas female circumcision has none, only harm.","if forcible preventative surgery for speculative future ailments could be considered a health benefit then parents could justify removing almost any infant body part. for example, cutting off her ears so she doesn't get earlobe cancer."
Attack,"to call the absence of something immoral is to raise the requirement of positive obligations. positive obligations are most infamously contained in the marxist claim from each according to his ability, to each according to his need, which have led to the greatest atrocities in the history of the world.","the marxist defense of those atrocities was the concept of the dictatorship of the proletariat not from each according to his ability, to each according to his need"

Attack,"israeli settlements are often built on private palestinian land which is illegally acquired, often by evicting palestinians from their homes. this reduces the land owned by palestinians, narrowing the potential space that could be allotted to a future palestinian state.","in cases where palestinians are able to show land ownership, as around amona , this obstructs further settlements."
Support,"the jews did not bury criminals in tombs, they buried them in common graves.","mishnah sanhedrin 6:5 says, after the executed transgressor is taken down he is buried, and they would not bury him in his ancestral burial plot. rather, two graveyards were established for the burial of those executed by the court..."
Support,"the substantial gender discrepancy between male and female characters sends a message that males are more important or interesting than females, and thus are portrayed more often.","a study of a total of 47 games showed that of the 597 characters analyzed, 71.52 of the characters were men, 13.74 were women and 14.74 were non human characters. this shows that players are more likely to have an opportunity to play a non human character than a female p.8 ."
Attack,controlling the thoughts of a sentient being like a human is widely considered to be ethically inexcusable.,"if it were possible to manipulate thoughts, memories, or the mind humanely, it is possible that popular opinion would change."

Attack,"mental health issues are stigmatised by hinduism, which can make it difficult for followers to seek effective help.","hinduism teaches that every illness has a biological, psychological, and spiritual element; this offers those suffering from mental illness an opportunity to learn more about the way their mind works and find meaning pp. 5 6 ."
Support,visionaries and people with great innovative ideas might not get as rich as they would in a capitalist country.,the support for visionaries is often limited in a community because people are reserved when it comes to change so in a communists environment they wouldn't get any recognition. in fact in some cases they could get shot by the communist community.
Attack,obese children are very likely to experience harassment and not succeed in education.,children are less likely to become obese if the lifestyle is stigmatized.
Support,there is hardly any free speech supressed by pc. the ideas can as easily expressed in a different way.,"there is hardly any free speech suppressed by pc because it is limited to offensive things like sexism, racism, etc. these things are never used by a lot of people, and of those who do, few revolve their life around being offensive."
Attack,"humans are at the top of the food chain, which means that they are merely following the natural order of things when they kill and eat other animals.",there is no logical connection between our current position in the food chain and the justifiability of eating animals. such a reasoning is circular because what puts animals on a lower level than us is eating them.
Attack,the death penalty for homosexuality is primarily applied in islamic countries.,"this statement is only true of this era in history. in the 19th century and earlier, homosexual behavior was punishable by death in much of europe p. 2 ."
Support,"feminism actively and wilfully hides, downplays, or covers up sexism that does not serve women.","mary koss whose work into sexual violence against women is nothing short of heroic, coining the term date rape , and literally writing the definition of rape for the cdc categorically denies a man can be raped by the exact same act a woman can vaginal intercourse. as such, male rapes are overwhelmingly underrepresented ."
Support,"even if a foetus does not look, walk, and talk like those outside of the womb, it has the potential to become a person. it is this potential that should be respected and preserved.","not all infants develop into adults. however, this does not justify labeling infants as non persons, as is often the case with foetuses."
Support,consumerist culture has a negative impact on society.,consumerism negatively affects the environment and leads to pollution and climate change.
Attack,"in a representative democracy, elected officials by definition represent the citizens they govern, and thus sharing interests, values and characteristic with their constituents is vital to be effective political figures and represent their citizenship in the best possible way.","this is only indicative of the fact that being representative of the society they are elected from is important for elected representatives in a representative democracy. this is not relevant to other types of political figures and to other political systems, such as monarchs in monarchies."

Attack,"being inside the single market would allow turkish citizens the freedom to move to work anywhere in europe . therefore, if turkey joins the eu, it may lose many of its most talented workers as other european countries have higher wages .","over time, some of these workers may return to turkey with new skills that can benefit the turkish economy."

Attack,star voting encourages candidates to appeal to a wide range of voters.,"the candidates will attempt to have the least possible appeal to each individual voter, rather than attempting to sway any significant number of them and alienating others."
Support,political science is a part of science. political science is political. therefore at least a part of science is political.,political expert groups have gained more control over politics at the cost of voters. this is called technocracy.
Support,"the eu has a responsibility to protect the health and wellbeing of its citizens. given the negative health outcomes associated with the use of cannabis, legalizing it would constitute a dereliction of this responsibility.",long term consumption of cannabis can have negative and irreversible effects on both mental and physical health.

Attack,"many of the rights guaranteed to women by islam would not be guaranteed until much later in the non islamic world; for example, islam was the first religion to give women rights of inheritance .",the fact that islam was a force of liberation at the point of its inception is irrelevant if it is a cause of oppression in the modern day.
Attack,"to this day, cities and towns with large mexican american populations usually hold parades, put on shows with mariachi music and folk dances, and enjoy traditional food.","this doesn't mean that the mexican american population supports these activities, but only that this is what the american population has come to expect."

Attack,many palestinians do not themselves support the two state plan the us will base its recognition on. this makes it unlikely that such a plan will ever be successfully adopted.,"palestinians would welcome a show of us resolve in this question. as of 2009 , eight out of ten saw the american lack of resolve as a major contributor to the lack of progress in the peace process."

Attack,by claiming that things are good and evil necessitates the existence of a lawgiver. there cannot be moral obligation without the existence of god as the ultimate lawgiver.,"there is no power in divine moral obligations if everyone interprets them differently, or believes in different ones. in fact, avowed divine support allows the committing of acts of extreme atrocity by political establishments, and public opposition remains absent for fear of god's disapproval."

Attack,the british monarch still holds the title 'defender of the faith and supreme governor of the church of england '.,"as most eu democracies are laic or non confessional and have freedom of religion, the connection between the monarch and the established church is a ceremonial leftover with little substance: therefore citizens are free to practice any religion."
Attack,"most of the animals killed by humans for food such as cows, pigs, and chickens do not usually kill humans or each other.",most predators are not eaten by their prey. the fact that gazelles do not eat lions is not a reason to stop lions from eating gazelles.

Attack,agi would help mitigate other threats faced by society.,relying on agi to engage in these risks might create a dependency that would make humans ineffective in the long run in resolving these threats if the agi fails or goes rogue.
Attack,"if members of a global police force started to be deployed anywhere in the world irrespective of their nationality, local public perceptions of visibly or audibly 'foreign' police being swayed by ethnic, racial or cultural bias would likely be a more frequently occurring phenomenon.","this could easily be solved if the global police force chose not to randomly deploy officers, but instead had region specific units who fit the cultural mores of the area."
Attack,"those goals or meta goals would still be set by humans, e.g. companies.","insofar as current ais like chatgpt or claude have goals, they are trained through imperfect techniques like rlhf and were not written by their parent companies. so, this statement is not even true for present ais let alone future ones."

Support,it is a misconception that gun owners are opposed to stricter regulation; there is evidence that the majority of gun owners favor additional restrictions .,"even among those who favor gun control legislation, there is little public interest in banning the use of guns for recreational purposes p. 38 ."
Attack,"it is more probable that, in a world without borders, immigration to europe would increase to such a degree that the political influence of immigrant communities would entirely drown out the political influence of right wing populists.","social media, news outlets, and the fake or sensationalised news they spread can be used effectively by such political parties, even if they are few in number relative to a region or nation's population. this can exert an effective, insidious political influence."

Attack,"human beings have an inherent need to explore and overcome limits. once all limits have been overcome, human beings will experience a loss of meaning, as they would be left without any limits to overcome.","transhumanism will only uplift physical and material limitations. limitations of the thought, feeling, experience, and connections are still going to exist in some form."

Support,turks that live in european nations pay tax to the nations in which they are residing.,"many european nations have aging populations. this places increased strain on the ability of these states to provide welfare services for its citizens. if turkey becomes a member of the eu, more turkish migrants will be able to move to eu states and pay taxes. this could help to prevent the economic problems caused by an aging population."
Attack,"the word for virgin in hebrew is ב תו ל ה bĕthuwlah. however, isaiah 7:14 does not use the word bĕthuwlah. this word would have been used if the intent was to convey a virgin birth.","gordon 1953 notes that in an ugaritic text a bride is referred to using the etymological counterpart of bethulah in one verse and using the counterpart of almah just two verses later. plausibly, the words were seen as interchangeable."

Attack,"moral relativism argues that morality is fluid based on one's perspective of right and wrong. religion is morally absolute since it derives its morality from the word of god which is the final authority. hence, to have consistent and absolute moral standards, religion is necessary.","many religions exist, with many different gods, and there is no valid method of determining which religion is correct if any at all."
Attack,"there would otherwise be no reason to consider human life valuable in the slightest, particularly humans that do not have 'useful' or 'valuable' traits.","evolutionarily speaking, all human life indirectly supports survival of the species. in this respect, human life has value."
Support,we don't 'choose' any action or whether to act or not act. free will does not exist.,intentions ultimately dissolve into nonexistence when all human behavior comes about due to physical laws be they causal or acausal laws . therefore: intentions are practical rather than physical realities.

Attack,"trump became president against all the odds, indicating that he possesses profound political acumen.",trump s opponent clinton was perceived as untrustworthy .
Support,government professionals involved in developing school curriculums are not immune to the biases that render parents ill equipped to teach their children about gender and sexuality.,partisan interests determine who is appointed as the secretary of education . this presumably has implications for how controversial topics such as gender and sexuality are taught in schools.
Attack,"schools should prioritize achieving the objectives of education, not catering to the preferences and enjoyment of children.","education should not be solely focused on the needs of the economy or society, but also on the holistic development of the individual, including their personal interests and passions."
Attack,lay people feeling more included in the church's decision making could lead to increased numbers of people staying in the church.,changing the decision making process could lead to anger among more traditional catholics who trust the current process to make the correct spiritual decisions.
Attack,"the state should only protect rights and not provide rights. everyone has the right to be protected from thievery, but nobody should have a right to free stuff.","the state, through the democratically negotiated rights enshrined in law, protects all rights, whether that is the right to be protected from theft or the right to freedom from poverty. the rich always privilege law and order in discussions of this nature, but there is no reason why theft is different from targeted poverty. both are violations towards the dignity of members of society."
Attack,"delivering a baby doesn t force loving it. if she finds herself unable to love it, it can be given for adoption.","there are far too many children than there are good foster homes. we must increase a large number of new foster homes to care for the many children we already have on waiting lists, before we create a large new influx of babies if abortion is made illegal."
Attack,"there is no historical precedent for positive collaboration between rivaling countries. look at the colonization of americas. although it did produce positive results in the long run, the colonization process itself was little more than massive land grabs to fuel wars.","colonisation in the classical sense always revolved around occupation of land for prime access to resources and or for geostrategic considerations and habitat for growing populations. mars does, in the near future, not promise to serve any of these aspects such that nobody profits from war."
Attack,"a one world state would make it much easier to implement grassroots local governments , which are considered more meaningfully representative than central governments in nation states p. 15 .","creating local governments and giving them control over policy would defeat the purpose of creating a world state, since it would create de facto separate states."
Attack,families that abide by traditional gender roles tend to be happier and more stable.,"the un has said that gender stereotypes can harm and limit children's capacity to develop their individuality , pursue their professional careers, and make independent choices."
Attack,we live in the 21st century and should progress out of the less civilized ways of living such as eating meat. the vegetarian movement will lead to more innovation as the meat industry ages and becomes obsolete. humanity could advance ideas such as feeding the future population and colonizing other planets when moving away from meat.,"evolutionary speaking, hominids only had access to meat after coming down from the trees, which means eating meat came after eating fruits and vegetables, and is therefore more civilized. moreover, eating meat required the invention of weapons to hunt, and the discovery of fire, furthering the correlation between meat and civilization."
Support,bodily autonomy is not an unlimited or absolute right.,the right to life should trump the right to bodily autonomy because the right to life is a precondition to accessing bodily autonomy.
Attack,"the same page of talmud says what does the inciter do? he says: there is an idol in such and such a place, which eats like this, drinks like this, does good for its worshippers like this, and harms those who do not worship it like this. jesus did not do this, and so would not be an inciter in the required sense.",jesus may have been understood by his opponents as inciting idolatry by claiming that he was god and deserved worship.

Attack,"parenting education programs have been proven to work effectively in improving parenting, and could be easily integrated as part of a licensing system p. 2 .","parents can learn about parenting through dedicated classes, meet ups or parenting books. it is not necessary to implement a licensing process to offer educative experiences for prospective parents."
Attack,"if jesus died willingly and knowingly, and rose three days later, there would be no reason to weep over his death.",there would be reason to weep over the fact that jesus was brutally tortured and murdered.
Attack,offending people for no reason breeds animosity in society.,"at times, speaking one's mind, or expressing one's opinion might offend someone. free speech is not just one person's right to talk, it is also one's right to an opinion and right to express that opinion, with the risk of offending someone."
Attack,trans women have used the controversy surrounding trans inclusion on sports teams to highlight the inequalities that are faced by all women in sports p. 2 .,"if trans women were truly concerned about the rights of all women, they would not seek to utilize the limited funds and facilities that have been earmarked for women's athletics."

Support,it is becoming increasingly difficult to accumulate wealth and buy assets in the modern era.,the price of property is higher now than ever before.
Attack,"the praetorian guard fight was intense but sadly and clearly was not a lightsaber duel. the praetorian guards wielded vibrio voulse, bilari electro chain whip, double blade, and electro plasma sword. none of them used lightsabers","a lightsaber fight does not mean both parties are using lightsabers. there is a tradition of defining the titular weapon within a fight as being the most powerful weapon in a fight. in the untouchables malone states that someone has brought a knife to a gun fight not because both have guns, but because he has a gun."
Support,challenging existing social norms regarding bathroom use could lead to people feeling uncomfortable when using public bathrooms.,gender segregation of bathrooms reinforces the narrative separation of men and women which maintains the psychosexual wellbeing of heterosexual people.
Attack,"if personal finance is merely an elective, many students might decide not to take the course for fear that it is not academic enough and would therefore hurt their chances for college admissions.","only 62 of high school students go on to college, so the remaining students may be interested and well served by life skills electives."
Support,methods of nonverbal communication vary significantly from culture to culture.,"high context cultures mediterranean, slavic, central european, latin american, african, arab, asian, american indian look for meaning and understanding in body language, silences, pauses, relationships, and empathy. by contrast, low context cultures most germanic and english speaking countries emphasise sending and receiving accurate messages directly, and being precise with spoken or written words."
Attack,"the very fact that the mother does not wish to have a baby means that its existence would be detrimental to her welfare. for example, it could bankrupt her, destroy her plans for the future, and rob her of time that she wishes to invest elsewhere.","a mother not wishing to have a baby because it might be detrimental to her is not self defense . self defense applies when the other person is not merely inconvenient, but threatening your life."
Attack,"reducing government bureaucracy has a cost. moving to a ubi system would put thousands of government employees, currently working in the welfare system, out of work. the transition will be difficult, and needs to be handled delicately.","maintaining inefficient programs to preserve jobs will lead to a very inefficient society in the long run. the cost of a delicate transition period is a one time cost, whereas the cost of keeping people at work to support inefficient welfare programs is a continuous cost."
Attack,"science holds in abeyance hypotheses that have not been sufficiently demonstrated, assigning them neither true nor false values and making no statement based on them. science makes no statement about the hypothesis of a deity, so cannot be held to support or refute atheism.","claims which are not sufficiently demonstrated are rejected as being true and then alternative hypothesis are then offered. the claim i am made of entirely of raspberry jam is analyzed and rejected as true. this leads to the separate claim i am made partly of raspberry jam which also rejected as true, leading to the alternative i am not made of raspberry jam which can be proven as true and is accepted."
Support,monarchs are more effective political figures than elected executives.,"the crown, composed of various members, permits that the representation of the state is simultaneously present in different places. the king might be dealing with major items of the governments' agenda while the queen, princes and princesses are supporting cultural, diplomatic or social initiatives together with charity events, etc. the duties of the head of state can be organically shared multiplying the country's presence."
Support,a socialist economy would increase the average income of workers.,"income inequality is part of the reason why welfare systems are necessary: in the case where nobody is in poverty, the state does not need to expend vital resources helping them out of it individually while ignoring the systemic reasons why people fall into poverty."
Attack,"if people could not talk about their potentially mistaken beliefs, it would be unlikely that they would ever be called out on them by experts.",ridicule by experts seems to have little effect on the promulgation of conspiracy theories and anti science sentiment.

Attack,historical fiction can have historical reliability if the author s do their homework. that doesn't make the story true.,historical fiction is a mischaracterization of the gospel of luke that would be rejected by nearly every historical scholar.
Attack,"if alien presence and activity on earth gets widely acknowledged, that may make their activity such as alien abductions or potential hybridization offspring programs more difficult, e.g. because they may be considered outside the current or then created bounds of laws or because people apply more countermeasures like certain monitoring technologies and so on.",they could continue flying their craft around covertly without registering these or getting these detected since they are so advanced that they can apparently easily avoid collisions.
Support,dc shows the slow progression of technology in a clean manner that makes sense.,"in the mcu movies, avengers infinity war and endgame showed a near instant jump in technological progression, such as nanite tech now magically being used in tony stark's tech."
Attack,"genetically modified crops reduce the use of pesticides, herbicides, fertilisers, and other chemical additives.","increased use of glyphosate containing herbicides in conjunction with herbicide resistant gmo crops causes the development of glyphosate resistant superweeds , leading to a renewed increase in economically and environmentally costly herbicides and farming practices."
Support,"large parts of the british public had a misguided perception of the eu, mainly due to ignorance and misinformation, and thus voted to leave.",interested and informed voters could have easily found out that the populists' numbers and facts about the eu were wrong.
Support,banning private cars will have negative economic effects.,banning private cars in large cities will hurt the national economy .
Attack,it will only discredit ideas among people who share that mindset. censoring discussions does not keep racists from being dismissive. people would rather want to know who the racists are.,"allowing people to insult, harass, and stereotype other people in the open helps the harassment spread."
Support,"cultural diversity will cause the disappearance of the organisation's traditional values, resulting in the loss of the organisation's original mission.",representatives of other cultures will impose their own values and habits.
Support,"the force seems to desire a natural balance, whereby the existence of powerful jedi or sith cause their counterparts to come into existence.",rey comes to that realization fast once she reaches out to the force with luke watching her. luke even goes so far as to say that she ...didn't even try to fight the dark...

Support,"enforcing the use of preferred pronouns is likely to cause a backlash, creating a more dangerous and dehumanizing environment for trans and gender non conforming people pp. 2 3 .",such a law would give rhetorical ammunition to right wing movements who claim that lgbt groups are extremely powerful and must be resisted. this could increase their support and harm lgbt people.

Attack,"to help reduce pollution, only low emission hybrid, and no emission electric vehicles could be permitted in large cities.",electric cars are typically much more expensive than gasoline powered cars; this would restrict the ability of poor people to drive into the city and limit them to public transportation.
Attack,religion shouldn't be allowed in politics because every religion cannot be true.,"democracy doesn't mandate that beliefs are true, merely that the beliefs of the population should be represented"
Attack,"it is easier, faster and more convenient to refuel a fossil fuel vehicle.","many of the factors that currently make the charging of evs inconvenient will go away as technology progresses, just like fossil fuel cars became more convenient over time."
Support,governments can turn a blind eye to pollution in favor of industry or corrupt pay offs.,in a voluntarist society it is likely the people would have more control over the courts than they do politicians in these governments. they could punish these companies more effectively in anarchism than under these governments.
Attack,"this would be a source of national pride for the country, as they would be getting back what may have been previously stolen or looted from them.","such pride could come at the cost of stoking harmful nationalist sentiments , which are already on the rise in many countries."
Support,the practice of polygamy is associated with several health risks.,just by having sexual intercourse with several partners at the same time exposes the individual to severe risks in terms of sexually transmitted diseases.
Attack,trans women suffer from violence at the hands of strangers and their partners.,trans women face a similar risk of gendered violence as cis woman because they are treated equally by a patriarchal society.

Attack,"capitalism is premised on inequality, since the objective is acquiring more wealth whenever possible. for someone to have more, someone else must have less.",capitalism is equitable by definition since it's based on trade where two people agree to exchange their personal items for mutual benefit.

Support,"if a country can decisively eliminate its attacker in a short amount of time, then they would be victorious with minimal civilian casualties.","if ukraine possessed nuclear weapons, then russia would have been less likely to attack them."
Support,"advanced technology is often conflated with advanced ethics and there is a widespread fallacy that progress moves in a line, from worse to better.","for example, living alongside other alien species at a distant place for a very long time in a small number may create conditions and pressures for other ethics, customs, laws and behaviors than e.g. the aliens home civilization at the time the spacecraft was sent off."
Support,many viewers think the educational quality of tv shows is generally poor.,"tv shows throughout europe are becoming less informative and more sensational, a european watchdog has found ."
Attack,"as the penis is designed to interact with a lubricated vagina, a dry hand may generate harmful friction.","there are many situations in which the vagina is not sufficiently lubricated on its own, but the penis can still enter it. if people can use artificial lubrication for heterosexual intercourse, they can also use it for whatever other kind of sex they enjoy."

Attack,twenty four countries and four non un members have not ratified the treaty.,the usa recognizes parts of some non ratified treaties as customary international law and binding upon them as such .
Support,"if the is ought problem is applicable to reality, then all moral statements or values ought's, must come from outside of what is. this outsidedness thus satisfies the requirement that for morality to be objective, it must not come from what is.","seeing what is and imagining a better is so much so that you formulate ought's to move what is closer to what it could be, must be objective to the situation since what is imagined is outside of the situation."

Attack,nearly every other important member of the early church is mentioned by name in acts.,bartholomew was not mentioned in the book of acts. yet we have good reason to believe he did extensive work in taking the gospel to india.
Attack,there is evidence suggesting that trans women offend at the same rate as men as the pattern of both overall crime and violent crime in trans women follows a male pattern of criminality p. 6 .,"suggesting that trans women offend at the same rate as men is a misrepresentation of the results of the study , which did not examine the likelihood to commit violent crime p. 7 ."
Attack,surely the guards would have at least been alert enough to notice a massive stone being rolled away not far from where they were standing.,jusus leaving the tomb having survived the crucifixion and the stone being rolled away don't have to have happened at the same time. more plausible explaination. 1. jesus recovers and quietly squeezes out from behind the stone without alerting the guards e.g. around dawn. 2. other people perhaps responding to rumours jesus had been seen alive roll away the stone to look inside 3. the body is indeed missing
Support,"historically, gun control laws have unjustly infringed upon the rights of marginalized communities of color by failing to protect their second amendment rights. expanding or adding new gun control laws could lead to further discrimination.","current gun control legislation has its roots in racial discrimination , which disproportionately prevents minorities from owning firearms."
Support,"the wealthy will get different enhancements than the poor maybe the wealthy will get brain enhancers while the poor will get physical ones . each side won't be able to compete with each other, because each side is specialized greatly in different areas than normal people cannot compete with.","for example, if a poor person without brain enhancements tried to compete for white collar jobs, they will not be able to, because the ones with brain enhancements will get the jobs. same with the reverse. a wealthy person will not compete with physical enhancements of the poor when they could just provide them to so many people just through funding it instead."

Attack,"ad populum. the christian scholars have obvious bias, and the secular scholars were educated in that environment. carrier is using the best methods: bayesian analysis of all available evidence.",carrier is likely biased as well. bayesian analysis certainly does not guarantee objectivity of analysis. dr. william ln. craig conducts a bayesian analysis of the resurrection hypothesis and concludes it is the most likely for explaining the facts surrounding jesus' death. is he credible just because he used bayesian methods? no.
Support,"young women increasingly engage with various forms of feminism on social media, spreading ideas through their offline networks p. 4 . this innovative approach can facilitate change, by passing polarisation.",social media activism encourages young women to create communities. this mobilisation is incredibly important as it encourages civic engagement amongst the traditionally disenfranchised .
Support,it would also unacceptably infringe on the child's future independence if their parents unilaterally decided to place permanent tattoos all over his her body. the point is the lack of objective necessity and the immutability of the consequences of the choice the parents make on the child's behalf.,"in many places worldwide, it is forbidden for a child get a tattoo or other body modification, even with consent of a parent. there is no reason for circumcision to be excluded from laws like these."
Support,the us economy as a whole would benefit from a ceo maximum wage.,almost 40 of us employers report that domestic labor alone cannot supply the level of skilled employees needed. increasing wages for foreign employees would attract workers from poorer countries to migrate to the us.

Support,gender is informed by factors both within and outside the individual.,"an individual's gender identity is internal, yet is informed by external social factors; an individual's gender expression presents their internal identity to the external world."
Support,"the culture you're born into is arbitrary . it is unduly restrictive to limit cultural sharing, even if it can cause harm, because of this.","early critiques of cultural appropriation saw it as a harm caused between groups with different levels of social power, whilst new readings focus on the individual. such arbitrary nature of social positioning causes harm."
Attack,"irrespective of whether a religion should or should not be involved in law making, when it is the case that laws contradict religious teaching in this case through allowing discrimination , religions should reject these laws.","if religious people ignore the law, it would set a bad precedent that could lead to anarchy."
Attack,"political correctness doesn't force people to articulate ideas more rigorously, it only forces people to attempt to articulate arguments in a manner deemed inoffensive. for any progress to be achieved in society, people have to risk offending someone.",pc culture can never stop people from offending others if they insist on doing so. it just means the offense will be met with criticism.

Support,"by this logic babies, little children as well as severely mentally disabled people cannot be possessors of rights either. but that would be wrong.","if conceptualisation of morality was a precondition to 'exist within our moral community' and to have the right to live and not be tortured and slaughtered, it would become permissible to harm pets, members of different moral communities different cultures , people in a coma, with dementia and many others"
Attack,jerusalem and zion are mentioned almost a 1000 times in the jewish scriptures but not once in the quran.,"it is questionable whether references in holy scriptures are the appropriate standard to judge religious significance. the bible does not mention the vatican, the pope or cardinals at any point, yet these stand at the center of the catholic church."

Attack,"the parent assumes sense capacities are the only capacities of the mind. this is an unwarranted assumption. if we take human minds as an example, which handle reasoning, thinking, believing, emotions, powers of the will, and powers to be aware of god, there there is no reason to think these capacities can t be used without a physical body to some degree.",see 1.1.4.2.3.1.2.4.1.1.1.7.1.1.1.2.1.1.1.2.3.1.
Support,self paced degrees allow people to fit studying around other committments .,self paced degrees allow people who need to work while in school a chance to do both.
Attack,"creationism requires understanding of even more complex reality such that requires a transcendental creator, and a timeless scale in which it exists. this concept is far more incomprehensible: what is a million of years compared to infinity?","why exactly was there a big bang? how did this universe end up with a consistent, stable system of particles and photons, against all odds? what is the substrate? given that spacetime, as we know it, had a beginning, and that time is correlated with velocity, a temporal scale should be considered transient. all that remains to be measured beyond it is the intransient, permanent properties of the realm in which the universe came to be. those are fundamental to questions of origin."
Support,"allows voters to fully express their political voice, as they can independently score each candidate.",informal surveys such as this and the british election study 's party ratings as well as these more direct studies indicate that voters use the expressiveness of a cardinal ballot to its fullest. french2007studies orsaytable electology.org

Attack,"in every instance observed of material objects with efficient causes, there were material causes also. exempting divine being s from this is special pleading.","beethoven s fifth symphony or tolstoy s novel anna karenina exist and they are not identical to particular marks on paper or particular published books. these exist as sort of abstract entities. a physical copy of anna karenina or a score from beethoven s fifth symphony is just an instance of that. it is not the thing itself. now, where did these come from? these would be examples of things that exist that have been created out of nothing by tolstoy and beethoven."

Attack,"among risks in a long term 10 year period, the survey ranks adverse outcomes of ai technologies at 6, compared to interstate armed conflict at 14, infectious diseases at 19, and biological, chemical or nuclear hazards at 26. therefore, the survey says ai x risk is more severe than nuclear war or pandemics over a 10 year period.",this claim is false: the report is not about existential or extinction risks from ai but ai risks in a broader sense such as an amplifier of risks during conflicts and across other societal issues like misinformation and disinformation.

Support,"fines imposed by the state typically go to public services . if more people opt out of paying fines using chatgpt, the state will have less money for public services that benefit everyone.","since chatgpt would not be as accessible to the general public as government services are, it would not be a net benefit to society if the use of chatgpt came at the cost of government revenue."

Attack,it is not democratic for people to simply believe what experts tell them . it is incumbent on politicians to justify and explain to the people why their claims are true and why the claims of others are wrong.,"politicians no longer need to explain why claims are true and false, as we are living in a post truth world. this allows politicians to simply ignore or subvert the truth."
Support,contemporary islamic terrorism in the west is not committed by the victims of the palestinian conflict nor people who show sympathy to the victims. terrorists use the plight of fellow muslims and religion as a guise for already existing radicalization and nihilism.,"empirical findings suggest that there is no correlation between immigration, including from conflict torn muslim countries, and terrorism."

Attack,"although there are many jewish doctors and scientists, they all had to learn to separate religion from society. judaism is based on the torah, a holy text that starts with a creation story which is today considered a myth because it's so far from the scientific truth of how humans came to be. judaism never negates the power of modern science, it is just a religion that is built on a myth, and so it cannot possibly be the religion that supports science the most.",most jews don't believe the bible is a literal account of what happened in the past.
Attack,ceasing to eat meat would mean that vast quantities of livestock would die without being replaced as they are unable to survive effectively outside of human agriculture.,the quantity of animals that exist is less important than having each animal posses a good quality of life free of suffering.

Support,many evs are just as capable as the fossil fuel cars for long trips.,"not only do evs currently have ranges comparable to fossil fuel cars, but battery technology is advancing rapidly. it won't be long before evs have a single charge range that exceeds anything a gasoline engine can do, and that can be fully recharged in times comparable to, or better than, that of refueling a gas vehicle ."

Support,"many historians are willing to grant that the account of the creation at the beginning of genesis is allegorical, while still arguing that much of the bible is a relevant historical document.","the work of scholars like israel finkelstein and neil asher silberman regards the early parts of the bible as historical, not because the creation story and other early pre history really happened, but because these stories really do provide us with a historically accurate anthropology of ancient israel."
Attack,"the us criminal justice system differentiates between self defense and criminal acts by assessing the presence of an imminent threat, reasonable fear, and the use of proportional force.",self defense laws are interpreted differently from case to case.
Support,there are special conditions in which papal infallibility applies.,"papal infallibility only applies to teachings , not actions."

Attack,this can be negated by a process through which the government purchases the artwork for a fair price.,"if the owner says no to a price, then the price offered is not the fair market value of the item. thus a system in which the government forcibly purchases confiscates artworks from its owners cannot be offering a fair price."

Attack,"religions hypocritically teach compassion, equality, and moderation; many religious institutions remain incredibly wealthy while much of the world lives in poverty.","plenty of clergy, and other religious followers, do take vows of poverty."
Attack,the difficulties associated with the implementation of such a language would outweigh the benefits.,"adoption would be a long term project over hundreds of years, which would largely solve problems of learning and transmission of the ul."
Support,"communism is the true system for the people, as it serves them better.","under communism, people are treated equally and are not discriminated on the basis of financial or social capital."
Attack,"it doesn't cross the is ought gap: i acknowledge that everyone rationally considers their own suffering bad. if something is rationally held, then another rational person should accept it unless there are reasons to think otherwise. as there are no such reasons, a rational person will consider all suffering bad if they think their own is bad.","no one rationally reached the conclusion my own suffering is bad from some other premises or evidence, if it counts as a rationally held belief then rationally held is a construct fabricated so that this supposed general principle could be used to leap across the is ought gap."

Attack,decreased demand for earlier chatgpt substitutes would make them more accessible and improve the lives of the less fortunate.,decreased demand for earlier substitutes for chatgpt would stifle their innovation and make them obsolete.
Attack,"the potential nutritional challenges associated with a vegetarian diet can be effectively addressed through informed dietary choices and, when necessary, the use of supplements .","the need of supplements is specially important among vegans, however, lacto ovo vegetarians can get adequate amounts of all nutrients needed from dairy products and eggs."
Attack,"it has been established as a physical possibility, via quantum tunneling. there is a nonzero probability of the particles of a corpse spontaneously rearranging themselves into a living organism.","while nonzero, the prior probability of this happening is astronomically small. even an elaborate hoax is far more probable than that."

Attack,"animals have a natural purpose and role to fulfill in the ecosystem, and derive dignity through their fulfillment of those roles.","the natural purpose of many animals is to kill other animals. it is therefore inconsistent to say that the natural role of animals is morally important, but also that it is bad for animals to suffer."
Support,"muslims believe the qur'an to contain the exact and literal words of allah , expressed in arabic. muslims did not choose to refer to allah using these pronouns.","since islamic doctrine teaches that allah is neither male nor female, some muslim feminists refer to allah using female pronouns as a method of undermining the patriarchy."

Attack,some have accussed the pope of adopting oversimplistic views on these conflicts. these criticisms have been especially loudly made by pro israeli groups .,"such criticisms often erroneously claim that the pope has not criticized hamas. in fact, he has done this and frequently calls for the release of israeli hostages."

Attack,"if the monotheistic god in question is the one described in the bible, then he is eternal and therefore not himself created or designed. who designed the designer is therefore not a problem.",the bible cannot be interpreted literally. it is mythology. this means claims of god's eternal nature in the bible may be figurative or hyperbole or later corruptions.

Attack,"the death penalty is often applied in an arbitrary, discriminatory, or inconsistent manner.",the legal processes a capital case must go through are rigorous and help to prevent injustice.
Attack,"the earliest complete bibles that we have are most likely copies of some of the fifty bibles that constantine commissioned. as the emperor of rome looking to use christianity as a political unifier, it would not have been unreasonable for constantine to exercise editorial control.",the biblical canon was most likely largely settled before constantine and the council of nicaea. there is thus no reason to suspect modification then.

Support,religions are routinely introduced to children who are too young to make an informed choice.,"the first communion is normally received around the ages of 7 to 10 after a period or cathequesis education . and confirmation , the time when the believer really gives consent, also happens when children are young or in their mid teens."

Attack,"as all the man made gods are of the' irrational, supernatural occult' they are the opposite to rationality and therefore could not be understood or explained by any process of logic.","logical and irrational ideal worlds would not run over each others. irrational worlds as being dream like, would not be able to gather memory and information by their nature. they cannot then have a purpose and reach it. the logical world could be attacked by an irrational invasive force but will rationalise it away and vice versa. this is paradoxical, as in the false analogy of the sword that cuts everything versus the shield that blocks everything. there are no winners or losers."

Attack,"the protagonists, with the exception of rey, are reactive rather than proactive.","this is not entirely true. poe shows initiative by seizing control. kylo ren has the most proactive moment of the whole film when he just kills snoke. luke is very passive during the whole film, but his most important moment is one of initiative."

Attack,the last jedi runs 152 minutes long. a fan edit that removed all female scenes only comes in at 46 minutes . 46 is a lot less than 50 of 152.,"the scenes that were removed weren't solely consisting of females. by removing scenes with women in it, the fan were also removing scenes with men in it."
Attack,"working under this framework there is no way to tell the two apart, especially considering religions often describe war and suffering at god's command, unless this was one of these devils demons all along.","discernment of spirits can be simple. a spirit that, in the end, by promise or treatment, elevates humans to a level of equality with god as the serpent did is false."

Support,"most humans cannot handle a complex debate in a language they are not fluent in. they do not have the vocabulary, grammar, or syntax.","different languages have different conceptual metaphors. for example, when we say the flat tire cost me an hour , you must already have the preconceived metaphor that time is money in order to understand it."

Support,some have estimated the average iq of graduates from the school trump attended to be higher than that of several other us presidents .,experts agree that he likely has an above average iq.
Attack,this is likely not a reference to the christian jesus of nazareth.,"sanhedrin 67a:15 calls ben stada the son of pantera, which fits with the theory that jesus was conceived by a roman named pantera."
Support,"higher transmission of disease can be a national safety and health risk, considering the accelerating fatal pandemics.","fatalities are losses in and of themselves, but they also induce a immense grief and aftermath for the families of the lost. this widespread grief can impede the function of society."
Support,it becomes easier to find and meet people globally that share similar interests to you.,"this has led to the growth of the e sports and subsequently the streaming industry, the first of which affords large prize pools hundreds of thousands to millions dependant on the game and the second of which can pay 'top streamers' thousands."
Attack,some trade unions have demonstrated success at closing the gender pay gap.,trade unions taking up the mantle of fixing the gender pay gap may be seen as unnecessarily exclusionary as they are meant to serve the needs of all their representatives.
Attack,characters that are relatable can be boring since they are behaving like average people.,there are a plethora of successful characters built on being humanly relatable.
Attack,"social pressure and research funding incentives have made it difficult for climate scientists to speak out against human caused climate change claims. as such, claims on the consensus of climate change should be doubted.","due to sensationalist clickbait journalism, a scientist that could present concrete evidence against climate change would be readily publicised p. 2 ."
Support,this argument employs the fallacy of composition ; the reasons for which gender neutral bathrooms work in some locations may not apply universally.,gender neutral bathrooms are presumably commonplace in areas with favorable legislative and public opinions on gender diversity and equality. this would not be the case when implemented in more conservative regions .
Attack,an individual's moral responsibility is difficult to define objectively and is therefore even harder to adhere to as a collective species.,"the vast majority of people agree that, in most cases, it is immoral to cause harm to other people."
Support,the struggle for trans women to create their own spaces does not mean that the gap should be bridged by women only spaces.,the burden of accommodating all oppressed groups should not fall on women. other spaces could take on the responsibility of being inclusive of trans women.
Attack,"if the candidate trades in a way that a voter doesn't like, then they likely would have governed similarly, and so the voter is better off having a candidate who only traded votes badly, rather than governed badly.",not necessarily. the rdo representative denied office could pass on proxy to a winner who governs badly.
Attack,the parent seems to think this is a problem for historicity of events surrounding jesus. the new testament is a collection of books. the sources describing the miracles of jesus are independent of one another.,the gospels are not independent. luke and matthew obviously copied from mark and added embellishments and john was written much later. the earlier epistles never claimed jesus was anything other than a spirit seen in visions.
Attack,the british empire frequently adopted ruthless violence to suppress dissent in their colonies. this is fundamentally undemocratic.,"modern democratic governments also use violence to suppress dissent, maintain control, and ensure social order."
Attack,"the legal system and government are overwhelmingly dominated by white men. these systems are and have been biased against women. if feminism counteracts such biases by demanding equality of rights, then this should be welcomed.",representation does not equate to equality. demanding equality of rights necessarily requires that all parties involved are held to the same standard.
Support,the pressure to redistribute wealth should not necessarily be assumed to be a bad thing.,"redistributing wealth, or at least addressing unethical income disparities, would be beneficial to society as a whole."
Support,the inability to tackle externalities is a primary reason why laissez faire capitalism fails .,"if x could produce immediate profit by utilizing toxic fertilizers that deplete the soil long term, then they'd be a succesful capitalist to the detriment of their society. thus government regulations would be required."
Attack,people are less likely to do things that are considered murder.,"this is only true if they themselves consider it murder, or if others will punish them for it as they would a murder."
Support,welfare has multiple sources of financing beyond income.,multiple streams of funding allow welfare programs to offer more funding to its dependents.
Attack,religion has many limitations associated with sexuality .,"religion supports family values and procreation, therefore it also supports sex."
Support,there are more important and ethical ways to spend taxpayer money than buying artwork.,"taxpayer money would be better spent on providing adequate healthcare and education to all citizens, rather than on artwork."
Support,"pc culture makes it hard to distinguish between satire and insulting language, which inhibits satirical expression.","pc occasionally limits comedy, even as it is meant neither as a threat, nor denigration."
Attack,"hard drugs are extremely addictive, but it is difficult to comprehend the extent of this before one has become addicted.","nicotine and alcohol are both legal yet are almost as addictive as hard drugs such as methamphetamine, cocaine, and heroin. thus, the addictive characteristic of a substance cannot be an argument in regard to its legal status."
Support,"individual corporations are far better equipped to solve the gender pay gap than the government, as they have deeper pockets and more flexibility to bring about change.",a wide variety of companies have made closing the gap a priority as it makes good business sense p. 1 .
Attack,"the central government has supremacy over local government. that means that every space, ultimately, is a federal government space.","the federal government only has supremacy on federal lands, and in narrow cases as authorized by the constitution."
Attack,the notion that transgender athlethes hold a competitve advantage over their cisgender peers is not conclusively supported by scientific evidence .,"the linked study explores a limited number of research articles, and only focuses on research related to transgender people."
Attack,"there are better alternatives to disallowing people with some genetic disorders to reproduce such as educating these people on their responsibility, the likely caused suffering, methods of contraception, and options like child adoption alongside measures to disincentive and discourage them from reproducing.","in cases where neurologic issues impede reasoning, education is unlikely to be successful."
Support,"when marginalized people request someone use pc language and the speaker refuses to do so, it dehumanizes them. thus, it becomes more likely that someone will commit violence against them.",dehumanization allows a perpetrator to morally justify doing violence to the dehumanized party. it follows that dehumanization is associated with less sympathy and more aggression.
Attack,"until a legal system to deal with the dangers that agi could pose is developed, agi should not be granted fundamental rights.","existing product liability laws laws that determine who is responsible in cases involving the design, functionality, and harms of products are already well suited to be adapted to navigating the legal complexities of ai and agi."
Attack,integrating technology like mobile phones increases classroom engagement for auditory and visual learners .,"only around 30 of individuals are auditory learners. since the are in a minority, integrating technology that benefits them over the majority would be inequitable."
Attack,"the term considers is highly subjective. the result of the research study could be and would be different if it were conducted using another different standard to assess happiness. i.e.: the higher the income, the more the happiness would engender a different outcome than the lower the divorce rates, the happier a country .","quality of life in a country can be objectively measured through happiness of residents, gdp per capita, quality of housing and food, etc."
Attack,"the government will always have a motive to indoctrinate people in certain ways, and if they fund higher education there will be no way to challenge them.",a policy of public funding may be developed without censorship or political propaganda by forbidding institutionalized control of the educational content itself.
Support,"pardons are typically granted toward the end of a presidency , but trump pardoned arpaio at the start of his presidency, and announced the pardon during the media frenzy surrounding hurricane harvey. this indicates that trump had an ulterior political motive which he attempted to bury amidst other news.",the trump administration frequently utilized the news cycle to its political advantage .
Support,"abortion must be a choice. the choice therein encompasses the responsibility of being fully informed of her own reasons for following through with the procedure, no matter her decision. lest she be viewed as unable to arbitrate in the eyes of the government and legal system, even in her full capacities.","the illegality of abortion strips the woman of the humanity of decision making. the decision to abort is never, ever a simple one."
Support,"parenting licenses may come into conflict with many religious beliefs, which could constitute an attack on their freedom of thought, belief or religion .","under some of the world's largest religions, procreation is seen as a god given right and, for some, a duty."
Support,"basing policy decisions on a pure majority opinion is just mob rule and allows the larger group to take from the smaller one, even if it's only slightly bigger.","a pure majority opinion may not necessarily represent the best decision for society as a whole, as the majority can be swayed by emotion or misinformation."
Support,"even if unguided evolution cannot explain life, it does not follow that life must have been designed. there could be a third option.","a third option could be by appeal to the anthropic principle, which states that embodied consciousness will arise only under the circumstances that precipitate its arising. thus the order and facts of the universe inevitably are what they are given that humans are here to observe them."
Attack,this already presupposes worlds and is only about the quality of their existence or whether or not they are real.,it does not presuppose anything; it allows for anything that's possible. world is simply a way of making reference to a collection of facts that are simultaneously true.
Attack,"openai is investing more into chatgpt, ensuring that the business will be successful for years to come.",investing more capital into any given business does not guarantee success .
Attack,some voters will be scared or confused about whether some voters picking more candidates than others gives them more power.,"in fact, it is fptp that gives voters who dislike a candidate but like several others less power than those who support that candidate. in approval, equal numbers on both sides will cancel out."
Support,"the parent is an unwarranted assumption. however, even if true, there is no reason to expect that god would answer to humans under such circumstances. it could very well be that god, a free being, has good reasons to not respond to humans attempting to measure his existence. arguing that god would do otherwise is an argument from omniscience.",god could not answer to humans at all and still exists.
Support,lectures are not for entertainment purposes and the urge to distract oneself is therefore unavoidable. laptops makes it easier to act upon this urge.,"as a law school professor puts it, his lectures can never rival the entertainment value of the web yamamoto, p. 487 ."
Support,"while it may seem cruel, academic and laboratory research often requires animal testing and experimentation in order to create products that save the lives of humans and animals alike.","animal testing is a core component of the modern pharmaceutical industry s drug research process , given the high risks that initial testing could have on humans."
Attack,forcing doctors to participate in a healthcare model is unjust and unethical .,"doctors are still able to provide their exper opinion on health related issues. thus, their underlying freedom as doctors are not being compromised."
Support,"fighting climate change is likely to reduce companies' profits. as such, it cannot align with business interests.","fighting climate change is a comprehensive process for businesses, involving numerous steps and analyses. implementing these measures requires direction and human capital which incur expenses."
Attack,"religion means well, but utilizes fear in order to gain compliance. fear is at the root of bad behavior. religion therefore negates itself as it enforces itself.","fear is a necessary part of human behviaour, and is one of the root causes of the flight or fight response."
Attack,forcing determinedly disruptive or anti education students to attend school degrades the education of their classmates.,mandatory schooling can accommodate disruptive students by reassigning them to diversionary schools or having them complete their education at home via remote learning.
Support,conservation can be achieved by limiting human interference with the natural world.,if society becomes dependent on zoos for ex situ conservation and breeding programs for the reintroduction of rare animals there may be less motivation to conserve and protect wild areas.
Attack,no meaningful hierarchy of rights can exist because all rights are interconnected . we require all of them to live meaningful lives.,being interconnected does not preclude some rights from being more important than others.
Attack,"sometimes disabilities can be misdiagnosed from prenatal tests. thus, aborting children who test positive for severe disabilities is unethical because some of those children may have been misdiagnosed .","only 8.8 of prenatal tests are misdiagnosed, and even fewer in cases of cerebral and cardiac malformations p. 1 ."
Support,"lgbtq education in schools could raise awareness of both less known or understood aspects of identity, thereby allowing children to explore the full range of possibilities under the lgbtq category.",society often projects an overly simplistic description onto the experiences of young lgbtq persons e.g. telling a young bisexual boy 'you kissed a boy! that makes you gay!' . education concerning the nuances of gender identity counteracts against such oversimplifications.
Support,"any action against chinese owned companies, such as tiktok, is likely to provoke retaliation from china, a nation with substantial investments in the u.s. economy.","a significant share of tiktok's revenue and assets, owned by china based bytedance, wll be redirected to its parent company in china, negatively impacting the u.s. economy."
Attack,"humans are part of the natural world. if morality is an irrelevant concept in the context of the natural world, it follows that morality must be irrelevant in the context of humans. but the author states that morality applies to humans. this is a contradiction, and therefore the claim taken as a whole is logically invalid.","this argument is based on the assumption that there is only one meaning to the word natural , whereas there clearly are at least two: natural as in encompassing the entire universe, and natural as opposed to artificial or anything derived from human thought and action."
Attack,many branches of buddhism promote belief in a variety of supernatural beings .,the buddhist worldview differs dramatically from that of scientific naturalism and does not distinguish between psychological and material phenomena.
Support,the european union is an example of a supranational body that has been extremely successful since its inception.,"in nominal terms , the european union is the second largest economy in the world."
Attack,electoral participation is decreasing among all voters in the us and the uk p. 35 . this is especially true of younger voters.,"the us youth vote, while lower than the voting rate for all age groups, has not actually decreased significantly more than the overall voter turnout has."
Support,some religious beliefs are opposed to human rights and well being.,"some religions disallow blood transfusion or organ transplantation , or else prescribe procedures, such as circumcision . this can be contentious when it affects the life and rights of a minor."
Attack,the phrasing alongside clearly suggests they belong in roughly the same category of risk also in terms of the magnitude of risk.,"if we think of category of risk separately from the magnitude of the risk, they are obviously the same category. even if you could argue that ai x risk is trivially unlikely, it's the same sort of catastrophe as a pandemic or nuclear war."
Support,a larger percentage believing they should stay does not indicate support across the group of people when it's not a majority and 44 is not a majority of african americans.,"among african americans, 40 support removal and 16 are not sure, therefore 56 do not actively support keeping monuments in place."
Attack,"it is unclear how having a license will result in parents being able to meet the costs over the course of raising a child, since unexpected eventualities such as illness or a period of unemployment or underemployment may occur.","while there is no guarantee that parents who are granted a license based on their financial situation at the time will continue to be able to support a child in the future, licenses would ensure that prospective parents who, beyond reasonable doubt, cannot afford to raise a child are prevented from doing so in the first place."
Attack,families in poor countries and rural areas in the developed world often rely on their offspring to perform agricultural tasks. small families are disadvantageous.,making a child engage in field work to support his or her family is inhumane and a violation of international child labor guidelines .
Support,"begging is a highly profitable form of child labour for human traffickers. even if other forms persist, they will be less profitable and thereby reduce the incentive for the trafficking of children.","if the children are not able to bring in money through begging, cartels will not have the profit incentive to traffic them."
Attack,"climate change cannot be reversed in the near future without collapsing the economy, which would cause extensive human suffering.",an increasingly wealthy planet may just mean that wealth is concentrated within the hands of a few. it doesn't mean that everyone has the power to adapt to climate change.
Support,"public health and public safety will generally improve as a result of mask wearing, both now and in the future.","wearing masks helps to ensure that people who cannot wear masks , such as people with respiratory conditions, will also be protected from catching the virus."
Attack,there is always danger of complications with anesthesia.,performing circumcision on an infant is a matter of safety. circumcising a child less than a year old decreases the risk of anesthetic complications.
Attack,"if gender equal conscription were instituted, entire generations could be endangered .","during a war, a country is unable to send a dangerously large majority of its population to the front lines since the home front needs to continue functioning and engaging in production."
Support,it might be difficult to employ dual citizens in important government jobs.,"for the us government, employing someone with dual citizenship may be a security threat."
Support,"lagrange colonies are not that portable being stationary when put into orbit , so they're not much better than mars for mobility.","the larger a lagrange colony's built, the more difficult it will be to move. so the enormous ones are going to be practically as permanent as mars, which offers no extra practical benefit when this takes place."
Attack,judges are often appointed by the ruling party and would be unlikely to remain impartial or rule against laws instated by the person who appointed them.,"in the us, it is somewhat common for judges to rule against the political ideals of the person that appointed them."
Attack,people who don't have a partner to have sex with could masturbate.,"while this does support the accuracy of its parent , the parent is still completely irrelevant, so this doesn't have an impact on its parent 's impact."
Attack,muslim women can remain feminists while disagreeing with western ideals of female emancipation and gender equality pp. 42 43 .,allowing women to live as they choose is a feminist ideal. imposing sharia law on women against their will is incompatible with feminism.
Support,"the catholic church used the inquisition to prosecute anyone who espoused views deemed as heretic for example, some scientific ideas convicting people to different sentences, including death by burning.","jan hus a czech theologian, philosopher, master, dean, and rector of the charles university in prague who became a church reformer, an inspirer of hussitism, a key predecessor to protestantism and a seminal figure in the bohemian reformation. he was burned at the stake for heresy against the doctrines of the catholic church on july, 6th 1415 and czech's still commemorate this tragedy by national holiday."
Attack,"homeschooling would help address issues of student tardiness and truancy, which are major barriers to completing education and are endemic in traditional schools.",some parents claim homeschooled status without legally homeschooling their children as they are not required to notify the school or state that they are withdrawing children from school.
Support,effective posts on x are often effective because of luck.,this is not something that more relevant psychological knowledge would help with.
Support,people save money in anticipation of raining days.,a person could have a car accident or breakdown and they could need urgent liquidity.
Attack,employers should be allowed to select workers according to their preferences and business interests.,employers do not have complete autonomy in the labour market.
Attack,emphasizing different points is to be expected from different accounts of events.,"different emphases would also be expected from different authors with different agendas, purposes, audiences, theologies, dogmas, or traditions. in contrast, we expect historical accounts to be largely similar or at least consistent."
Attack,"if someone made an honest mistake saying or doing something offensive, it shouldn't be hard to prove exactly that and give an earnest apology. however, what the person said or did is often indicative of their actual racist sexist classist views, so they will defend or even repeat what they said did. harsher criticism is entirely justified here.",it depends on the situation. the act of calling out is often itself an attempt to gain status or otherwise engage in rivalries. this manifests itself in in group purity battles which are definitionally toxic. this is a use of pc to engage in identity warfare and doesn't help anyone.
Support,"by assisting and supporting other well known brands in creating their own certification, fairtrade has extended fair trade practices across a larger proportion of global markets.","partially through a partnership with fairtrade, cadbury aims to source all of its cocoa through the fair trade scheme cocoa life by 2025. the impact of this deal is massive; mondelez , the parent company for cadbury, is the third largest chocolate producer in the world."
Attack,"the cosmological argument does not even suggest something personal or powerful . these are assertions added to cosmological arguments. inside the universe, we know of processes that increase complexity, order and size without power or personal agency e.g. biological evolution.",p3. the cause of the universe must be unimaginably powerful since it created all matter and energy.
Attack,software developers need to financially support themselves. open source software gives little way to do so.,there are many approaches developers could use to make money.
Support,the education provided by schools equips students with skills and knowledge that set them up for better mental health in adult life.,some schools specifically run classes to introduce students to both the concept of mental health and practices they can adopt to maintain good mental health.
Support,not all new mothers have the physical ability to breastfeed. wet nurses would also have to be mandatory.,many children are not able to properly breastfeed due to physical limitations.
Attack,"socialism hinges on public ownership of the means of production, not state ownership of it. state ownership and control of businesses, the flow of capital, foreign investment, etc. are aspects of authoritarianism, not socialism.",the public is not a coherent decision maker and cannot own anything. public ownership is a euphemism for authoritarian state ownership by whoever claims to represent the public.
Attack,"their predictions are more or less mere speculations and not well substantiated. for example, more computing power and increasing narrow task performances do not show that agi is likely to arrive.","many kinds of substantiation one might ask for about a claim, are literally impossible when it comes to predictions about the future. if we want to make plans about the future anyway, we have to work with what we have."
Attack,"the brief titled 'why women? inclusive security and peaceful societies' shows how women s inclusion helps prevent conflict, create peace, and sustain security after war ends stating women s empowerment and gender equality are associated with peace and stability",this does not support the original statement of women being superior to men. it only advocates in favor of gender equality.
Support,monarchies are the best political systems in order to guarantee freedom and democracy.,so called presidents for life achieve more easily power in countries without monarchy.
Attack,local and international institutions and can solve collective action problems through agreements like the paris agreement . the creation of a one world state is not necessary.,"these agreements such as the paris agreement and many un resolutions are usually non binding, or unenforceable, which would presumably not be the case under a one world state."
Attack,video games can help people overcome the challenges of meeting new people and staying connected with others when circumstances would prevent them from doing so in person.,"while video games can help people connect during isolating circumstances, like stay at home mandates, prolonged gaming can make it more difficult to adjust to life after isolation."
Support,"supply side economics is not solely concerned with the taxation of corporations, but with taxation and economic policies more broadly. even if corporate tax cuts are harmful, supply side economics can be net positive.","if tax cuts on income create the spending and economic activity that is desired in supply side economics, this can create a counter balance to any harm incurred by corporations."
Support,"there's a grave difference between islam and the two other religions. in judaism and christianity the messages from god have always been interpreted by a human before written in the holy scriptures. therefore we cannot trust the text as being entirely in line with what god intends to say. but in islam, the koran is allah's direct word . therefore muslims cannot deviate from the word of the koran, which means they can never adapt to the western societies' values.","the koran has to be allah's direct word, as the prophet mohammed was unlettered and could not have written it himself in perfect arabic."
Support,"there have been cases of governments determining that children of jehovah's witnesses should receive blood transfusions, even in the face of objections from their parents.","the supreme court in canada ruled on such a case, saying that 'such medical interventions are constitutionally sound, striking a balance between the choice of the child and the state's protection of the child.'"
Attack,marginalized groups can effectively move the majority.,that minority groups can and have had the most successful movements does not mean that majority groups who advocate for minority groups are harmful.
Support,"the empire strikes back has one of the most significant lightsaber fights of all the movies, with vader revealing one of the greatest twists in movie history.","in rankings by various websites of the lightsaber fights throughout the star wars movies, this fight routinely occupies the first or second or third position usually before any other duel from the original trilogy ."
Attack,men would be deterred from falsely representing themselves to gain access to women only spaces if society established a strong degree of trust between people allowed in those spaces and people who are clearly prohibited from entering.,"some men are inherently untrustworthy ; society needs rigid rules to protect the most vulnerable, especially women."
Attack,"gun technology has dramatically changed since the second amendment was introduced. fully automatic weapons today can fire up to 1000 rounds per minute, whereas a gun in 1781 could only fire a single manually loaded shot at a time pp. 3 4 . as such, gun laws in the context of the constitution are outdated.",the right of civilians to make use of available weapon technology to defend themselves against government oppression is not affected by advances in such technology.
Support,"even if an entity knows the future actions of a person, the person can still have free will.","people alive today know the future actions of historical figures, but that does not mean the actions of those historical figures were not free."
Support,"one could increase the speed and extent by which 'good actors' mitigate the impacts and causes of such assuming this is a substantial problem. this can be done through facilitation, feedback systems, economic incentives, structural designs, policies, education, media, and more combined with systematic identification of potential countermeasures as done for example for online misinformation .","regarding online misinformation potential measures include incorporating media literacy and digital literacy in school curricula and incentivized adult education combined with things like x community notes , bot replies to misinformation posts , support for structured information system orienting toward neutrality and evidence based integration of information, and independent assessments."
Support,allowing hate speech in the public sphere allows it to grow and become mainstream.,free speech has been used to attack democracies by religious leaders inciting terrorism .
Attack,the us does not meet the legal definition of a 'failed state'.,this is an appeal to legalism. what's legal is not always the best policy.
Support,the current form of capitalism is causing a widening of the income inequality gap.,"analysis by the ifs has shown the share of income going to the top 1 of richest households has nearly tripled in the past four decades, from 3 in the late 1970s to about 8 today."
Attack,historical evidence supports the existence of santa.,"the name santa claus derives from the name saint nicholas , who was a patron saint known to be a bearer of many gifts. that such a person existed at a particular time in history does not mean that such a character continues to exist."
Support,"at a time when lgbtq spaces are declining due to economic factors and changes in hook up culture , the patronage of straight people can help to preserve these spaces.","many heterosexual and lgbtq people are friends. thus, both groups should be welcomed in gay bars to ensure their long term economic viability."
Attack,"while we should certainly worry about rich capitalists surpassing the state in power, there is no evidence that this has happened.","many super wealthy philanthropists are supplanting certain state functions, as well as heavily influencing state policy."
Support,the turkish government has taken measures to hold the construction companies primarily responsible for the damage accountable.,the turkish justice ministry has placed 134 people under investigation for their role in the construction of the buildings that collapsed following the earthquakes.
Support,peace is a central concept in most religions pp. 20 21 .,religious beliefs and leaders can play a crucial role in peacekeeping efforts .
Attack,government instability can easily lead to a lack of rule of law and an increase in human rights violations.,"research points that even if strong inequality is one of the main factors for conflict and violence, the longer and more stable a democracy is, the more equipped it is to avoid conflict and to strengthen the social contract."
Attack,"there are numerous reasons of why people believe in god, and some of them haven't anything to do with proofs: family pressure, wishful thinking that death isn't the end of life, indoctrination, just because they feel it , agent detection , etc.",there are many things which are true that some people believe for bad reasons. people believing something for bad reasons doesn't not mean it's not true.
Attack,playmaker describes one of many roles in a team . just because a player doesn't excel as a playmaker does not mean that they don't excel in other roles.,"the position is unique in that players who occupy it can make or break a team's efforts. accordingly, the international federation of football history statistics has special awards for this position as well as goalkeepers and goal scorers."
Support,"wealth creation in many occupations often leads to high levels of stress , which is bad for one's health.",stress can lead to burnout and bad health habits for high earners like wall street bankers.
Support,high pay often does not result in high performance .,the performance of executives barely determines their pay; a much better indicator for executives' pay is the size of companies p. 329 .
Attack,not all new mothers have the physical ability to breastfeed. wet nurses would also have to be mandatory.,exceptions would apply for mothers who cannot breastfeed for valid reasons.
Support,"design thinking has no cohesive, consistent definition.","like many buzz words in the business world, the phrase design thinking is used to just mean design something without any actual reference to a specific methodology, as a result it has become an empty phrase separated from it's original meaning across a large part of the industry."
Attack,"nobody, be they feminist, egalitarian or mra has the right to dictate who gets to speak and what they get to speak about.",protesting against a talk is something far different than dictating who gets to speak or a totalitarian rule . freedom of speech does also protect criticism against talks. protests are just the use of this freedom.
Attack,"by being alive, we alter the course of the universe in a tiny but measurable way. the definition of the universe is therefore altered by our existence. this is meaningful because we contribute a small piece to everything that exists.",whether or not a given amount of matter is alive doesn't change whether it affects the rest of the universe. the quality of being alive is unimportant; only the quality of being real is shown to be important by this reasoning.
Support,trans women do not benefit from cisgender privilege pp. 1 2 .,"nearly one third of trans people in the us live in poverty, which is almost twice the national average ."
Support,"studies have shown that positive group experiences contribute to student learning, retention, and overall college success .",group projects can help students develop soft and social skills that are increasingly important in the professional world.
Support,'political correctness' has become a catch all phrase used an as ad hominem to avoid a meaningful argument.,"pc can be used as a pejorative term, along with words like 'snowflake'."
Support,laws are dependent on the historical context of the time. legal history is a specific field that studies this relationship and can be incorporated into a lesson.,"by studying 'law in context', students would better understand how the many ways legal norms and institutions are conditioned by culture and social ."
Support,studies show that areas with high populations of illegal immigrants have reduced crime rates as compared to other areas.,"conversely, increasing deportations in areas with a lot of unauthorized immigrants didn t reduce local crime rates."
Attack,people make mistakes all the time and many of them have conflicting beliefs. this does not mean in any way that it is not contradictory.,"when people's actions contradict their endorsed beliefs, this is not the same as a logical contradiction in an argument. a logically contradictory argument is proven false, people do not get proven false, they don't vanish in a puff of logic when caught in hypocrisy"
Attack,it is difficult to change leadership in a monarchy.,"the monarchs are the leadership only on paper, the actual leadership the democratically elected prime minister and leading parties is not difficult to replace."
Attack,feminists often claim men treat women as second class citizens,"the fact that there's still a gender pay gap and the glass ceiling for women to reach management roles, proves that men don't treat women as equals."
Support,"when also considering other data accumulated so far such as reports of alien abductions and incidents like the ariel school ufo incident and statements or investigations by relevant officials , the extraterrestrial origin beings explanation seems to be most in agreement with occam's razor , which is an important established principle of science.","many governmental research programs list of major ones and documents, many of which are available on the foia requests based black vault website or are declassified and available on official websites such as that of the dia example or the internet archive, came to no conclusions and show how difficult to explain the events would be otherwise or provide various data that point towards the et origin beings explanation."
Attack,"many farm animals don't have their own native, wild habitat, and removing them from their farm habitat, by releasing them into the wild would very likely result in severe environmental, and ecological disruption. many of these livestock would likely fail to survive in the wild, and others would likely displace existing species of plants and animals.","we do not need to release farm animals into the wild , but could create sanctuaries for them in places where they previously lived until their natural death would occur. not only would that create jobs for those people transitioning from meat industry jobs, but would also help make the whole transition easier for animals and humans."
Attack,"the money earned from begging is entirely tax free and is immediately spent on food clothes services, moving it directly back into the economy .","since beggars are given change, it is likely that the donors would have used that money anyway."
Attack,"whether one is objectively measuring morality as a function of wellbeing, happiness, peace, rationality or trust, one still cannot escape hume's is ought problem all of these require value judgements.","standpoint epistemology proposes that, even though individual perceptions of the social world are always rooted in particular standpoints, collective discussion incorporating all relevant social standpoints can produce objective or comparatively objective accounts of society. therefore, if morality is social in nature, then a properly inclusive collective discussion could produce objectively true moral statements."
Support,"religious schools, in their attempt to deny employment to teachers who identify as lgbtq , deprive students, who may identify as lgbtq , of the guidance that they really need, particularly at a young age.","as a potential result of these exemptions, students educated in religious schools will be unexposed to members of the lgbtq community. hence, there is a greater likelihood of these students growing up with oppressive opinions. this will adversely impact the strive for equality in society and the impacts of these exemptions are hence not limited to these religious institutions."
Support,"children may be conditioned to believe that single sex schools are conducive to better learning outcomes. therefore, the benefits may not be inherently attributable to single sex education.","historically, schools were typically segregated by gender . justifications for these practices may be generationally transmitted, thereby reinforcing the belief that single sex schools are inherently better."
Support,anarchist law can be subverted by the powerful or organized if there is not enough publicly believable evidence of the truth in that specific dispute by making it too costly for the law men to accomplish justice.,"if the criminal has too much military power, potential protesters, economic manipulation allies, or public support it maybe infeasible for a court to accomplish justice."
Support,"homosexual couples cannot have children. therefore, they are less likely to have a healthy family.",having a child can strengthen a couple's relationship.

Support,"many animal species experience a range of emotions such as happiness, resentment, joy, sadness and empathy.","studies suggest that the experience of fear and trauma among some animals can fundamentally alter their psychological and behavioural makeup, in a manner that is consistent with ptsd."
Attack,"homeschooling often occurs in largely homogenous communities , making students less tolerant of those who differ greatly from those communities.",adults who were homeschooled are more politically tolerant than those who attended traditional schools .
Support,"the freedom to walk safely through a city is also important, yet is substantially reduced by the omnipresence of cars and their implicit risk to pedestrians.",pedestrian deaths were at an all time high in 2019.
Attack,"the concept of self defense is problematically egocentric, thus hindering the greater value of social cohesion.","this assumes that people are receiving offense when none was given prompting an illegitimate defense which would in fact be an offense. the right to defend one's self against that kind of offense, would be proper self defense."

Support,"throughout history, men have often been considered the default producers of creative arts; this has facilitated the exclusion of women from discussions of humanity and perspective in creative arenas and beyond.","there are a number of examples of men taking credit for artwork, sculptures, and architectural renderings created by women, putting themselves in the spotlight unduly."

Support,chatgpt will make the criminal justice system more efficient.,people have used chatgpt to successfully appeal fines.

Attack,religions have had a profound influence on the concept and procedures of marriage.,"given the high number of divorces, the church, particularly the catholic church, is no longer exerting great influence over marriage practices."
Support,the ability to understand the concepts of good and evil does not imply the ability to understand their relationship to the nature of god.,"just because we understand evil in this world, doesn't mean we understand its eternal significance."
Support,it is often difficult for governments to censor news stories before they are published.,"even where restrictions on press freedom exist, only in the most repressive countries do governments insist on approving news stories prior to publication."
Support,the inability to tackle externalities is a primary reason why laissez faire capitalism fails .,"since ocean areas often lack legally defined ownership, overfishing is a classic analogy for failure states in free market capitalism."
Support,control over an agi by any group would give them enough power to dominate world politics or the economy.,"an agi would have the power to imbalance the world economy and rather than provide abundance to all, benefit only select groups."

Support,"that something is natural, is not a consideration of morality.",blindly considered bad just because a thousand years old book said so is a poisoning the well fallacy.
Support,"capitalism only treats people as equals on paper in practise, it is full of unequal treatment.","it is absurd to suggest that capitalists controlling a greater proportion of the world's wealth than any feudal monarch are equal to their workers, or to the poor and homeless."
Attack,"through social media and other forms of digital communication, those with oppositional views have more means than ever to commmunicate with one another.","although social media may give more opportunity for communication between those with opposing views, it does not guarnatee any form of meaningful dialogue."
Support,"banks consent to provide student loans. by providing loans, banks open themselves up to the possibility that the amount lent may never be recovered.","banks are required to undertake due diligence prior to loan syndication. bad loans are, therefore, an indictment of the quality of their evaluation of the trustworthiness of potential borrowers."
Attack,"p2: to say, if the universe has an explanation of its existence, that explanation is god, might sound jarring or improbable, but it is logically equivalent to if god does not exist, the universe has no explanation.","there are alternative scientific philosophical explanations for the existence of the universe, besides god. therefore the existence of the universe might still have an explanation, even if god does not exist."
Support,why would he allow so much evil in the world? even if eve messed up. isnt he a forgiving god? sentencing humanity to the kind of fate described in the bible seems a bit extreme to me for one measly apple.,"if god is truly kind and forgiving, why does he allow so much violence and pain in the world?"
Attack,chimps perform group stability policing similarly to humans.,that fails to explain the willingness of police officers and soldiers to die so that people they don't even know may survive. animals do not display this level of virtue.
Attack,"while much meat farming is cruel, it does not have to be. ethical consumers could choose only to buy from ethical sources i.e. free range farming that afford animals the same if not better quality of life than they would have had in the wild, and a painless death.","nothing in the world had to be cruel, it just is. facing the situation where animals are being constantly tortured in the name of bigger profits and simply advocate for a moral shift is an over simplification. defend an ethical way to produce meat is a nice thing but not practical"
Attack,people are likely to resist climate policies if they are forced upon them.,people are similarly likely to protest climate inaction.
Attack,social interaction loses most of its non verbal communication.,"social media platforms often have video calling features built into them, thus allowing for some degree of non verbal communication."

Support,some of the water used in production is wasted . taxing water would push companies to be more efficient.,taxing water would force companies to reuse or recycle it where they can in order to cut costs.
Attack,being able to afford to have more children would increase the number of children conceived and therefore necessitate a larger tax base to support a larger childcare system.,"it seems like a leap of logic to assume that the availability of childcare would cause families to grow larger. still, it certainly seems like it would be in a country's best interest to limit population growth, regardless the cause, to conserve resources."
Support,"the ancient israelites were subject to dietary restrictions, but humanity in general is not.",leviticus 11:1 47 specifically applies to the israelite people.
Support,ubis threaten corporations that depend on salaried employees that earn all of their income from them.,"a ubi could lead to increased employee turnover if employees are able to quit due to small dissatisfactions. this hurts companies, and in the long run, the economy."

Attack,"generative ai does a lot of the thinking for the student, undermining the goal of getting students to think for themselves.","requiring students to think for themselves would eliminate many perhaps most conventional teaching methods that already do most of the thinking for the student: syllabi constrain the scope of what students think about, assigned readings and instructor's lessons do massive amounts of the relevant thinking for students, labs are the result of generations of experiments that students don't complete, etc. students would need repeated socratic dialogues with bots to get nearly as much from bots."
Support,the presence of a separation of powers in israel serves as a robust indicator of a strong democracy.,"separation of powers forces cooperation among branches, reducing corruption and misuse of power."
Support,"the catholic church argues that, by seeing gender as a construct, children will be taught to be preoccupied with gender and to engage in 'rule breaking' that encourages them to choose lgbt identities.","in the catholic church's view, the desire to embrace gender non conformity is a confused concept of freedom that should be rejected, lest it harm families."

Attack,mandatory schooling promotes the academic and cognitive development of children.,schools often utilize ineffective educational methods that detract from learning p. 2 .
Support,"in general, laws are authoritarian in nature, and most people are willing to comply for the greater good.","during the covid 19 pandemic, governments imposed restrictions on individual liberty e.g., lockdowns, mask mandates . this proves that governments have the right to restrict bodily autonomy when public welfare is at stake."

Attack,globalisation is bad for the environment and contributes to climate change.,"globalisation makes it possible for environmental initiatives to have a global effect, whereas de globalisation could only spawn regional efforts."
Support,the will of the people is irrelevant in determining the guilt of a citizen who has committed a federal crime. the court of popular opinion should not influence the adjudication of criminal matters.,"the judicial system should be insulated from public opinion wherever possible to ensure that it embodies judicial neutrality , in accordance with its mandate."
Attack,believers and converts often consensually adhere to the social restrictions of a religion as the religion purports that there is value to that.,religions tend to take an all or nothing approach to their beliefs: the good consequences are overwhelming and require total conformance and the bad consequences are overwhelming and only require partial non conformance. thus believers have no real choice but to conform.
Attack,man has a sensus divinitatis sense of divinity that grounds justifies belief in god by the appropriate circumstances making it properly basic. plantinga speaks of sensus divinitatis as a disposition or set of dispositions to form theistic beliefs in various circumstances or stimuli that trigger the working of this sense of divinity.,having a disposition towards a belief does not make it true or a good thing. babies have a disposition to stick everything in their mouth this is not always a good idea.
Support,"using mobile phones for a means other than socializing, such as completing school work, helps to emphasize their usefulness as productivity tools.",a modern mobile phone is millions of times more powerful than the computers used during the apollo 11 mission . it is a waste to only use them for meaningless social purposes.
Attack,"amendments to the constitution can be altered or removed by a new amendment; for example, the 21st amendment was ratified in 1933 , repealing the 18th amendment and thereby ending prohibition.",a constitutional amendment could also further enshrine the right to bear arms and remove existing restrictions on gun purchases and ownership; such amendments have already been proposed in some states.
Attack,"college educated workers in the us view the integration of technology into the workplace positively, suggesting that if access to college education is improved in the us, then public support for automation will increase.","unless expanding access to college and trade skill education accompanies other measures for addressing wealth inequality , it is unlikely that conditions will improve in the us."
Attack,"for example, a holy man is expected not be controlled by materialistic desires things like sex life, riches, fame and fancy food because they should be getting a satisfaction from connecting to god.",if we apply this method to various religions we find many of them fall short much of the time.
Attack,"under planned economy, productivity is de facto discouraged despite being formally demanded.","this could be avoided by modifications to the organizational, management, or goal structure. quotas need not be strict and a spirit of communal cooperation can be cultivated."
Support,"it might be simplistic to pretend to separate religion from political, economical or other secular interests. the fact that there are many factors at play in historical conflicts does not exclude religion from being one of the factors contributing to war.","religion is articulated with other economic, social and cultural factors in order to exacerbate feelings of group chauvinism that are moved against the perceived deviant other."
Attack,animal testing is necessary for the advancement of medical science.,the results aren t always transferable to human anatomy and bodily functions.
Attack,"human life has a higher value because humans need and depend on each other, socially and economically.","animals are also responsible for important social tasks, e.g. guide dogs or therapy animals. humans depend on animals for these functions."

Support,feminism may struggle to make change as it promotes anti family policies and perspectives. these are legitimised by claiming that marriage and child rearing are patriarchal.,"some feminists believe women should work and take up the fight for equality instead of getting married, and raising kids as they do not believe it is possible or desirable to do both."
Support,maximizing the well being of conscious creatures is the only thing we can reasonably value.,"there is no alternative source of value beyond the wellbeing, or potential wellbeing, of conscious creatures. all other philosophical efforts to describe morality in terms of duty, fairness, justice, or some other principle indirectly draw upon wellbeing."
Attack,"we can create artificial substances to provide us with the nutrients we would normally depend on animals for, becoming completely self sufficient. no other animal can do this.",nature can create these nutrients more efficiently than humans can.
Attack,"johnson's quick resolution, or even complete jettison, of elements introduced by his predecessor smacks of design by committee a pejorative for a project with multiple designers but no unifying plan or vision .",it is less likely that design by committee would jettison plot elements because it is more likely that a committee would be retain some of the same creative talent. if anything jettisoning suggests that single creatives are being given creative freedom.
Support,"israel's unwillingness to engage in peace talks is due to domestic political considerations . a us declaration may empower small far right parties, and exacerbate the domestic barriers to negotiating a two state solution.",42 of israeli jews consider settlements to be beneficial towards israel's security. future governments will be constrained by the will of the public.
Support,"mass data collection is usually just sifting through a huge amount of data with very few relevant bits of information, most of which end up to be false positives.",a report on mass surveillance during the bush administration found that only 1.2 of leads pursued based on data 'made a substantive contribution' to identifying a terrorist or potential confidential informant.
Support,"if feminism expanded life choices for men too, then it would be an equality movement; it does not.","feminism neglects to acknowledge men's burdens in the workforce, which they should if striving for equality."

Attack,"having cisgender males compete with transgender athletes could cause them to feel uncomfortable, due to social expectations of gender roles and the biological differences with their competitor.","traditional gender roles should be removed, and this is one way to make progress."
Support,"shaming obesity, and the policies that accompany it, will similarly have negative externalities.","for example, sin taxes on consumption like a proposed 'fat tax' or 'sugar tax' are often incredibly regressive ."
Attack,"when different students follow different curricula, this increases the attainment gap between students of different socioeconomic backgrounds. teaching all students a standardised national curriculum mitigates this phenomenon.","despite the existence of national curricula , large syllabus differences between schools and individuals still persist according to type of school, socioeconomic status, teacher bias, and other factors."
Support,marriage is still important in society as a rational view of what a loving committed relationship actually is.,two persons binding themselves together are better able to build something up together. this needs a firm commitment that only marriage and its legal framework can provide.
Attack,ukraine is unlikely to be a useful ally to the united states beyond opposing russia.,"russia is largely viewed as the greatest enemy of the united states, and hence its suppression is, on its own, enough incentive for the united states to prioritise its relations with ukraine."
Attack,individuals could merely just purchase iron supplements.,the usage of supplements is not always the best method to replace sources of vitamins and minerals in a diet due to bioavailability .
Support,"laïcité, a french term that roughly translates as secularism , is central to their way of life and an expression of french identity .",president macron has cited secularism as the guiding principle behind his response to the terror attacks in france: secularism is the cement of a united france.
Support,studies have linked imf programs with higher levels of inequality as the programs target measures that aid the poor.,"egypt's economic liberalization, in line with the imf's advice, led to increased inequality in society, which eventually triggered a revolt by the people against the government."
Attack,"if polygamy were legal, a number of social institutions would help protect the interests and well being of women.","these institutions have already failed to prevent domestic violence , so they are unlikely to be effective at protecting groups at a higher risk of domestic problems."
Attack,globalisation undermines regulations in many areas as rich companies and individuals simply move to unregulated jurisdictions to avoid financial responsibility.,"globalisation is not directly related to companies or individuals profiting from lax regulations in some jurisdictions. in this case, those practices by these people are to blame, not globalisation itself."
Support,islamic religious doctrine institutionalizes patriarchy through its traditions and practices p. 66 .,the qur'an suggests that all of allah's prophets were men and not women ; many scholars interpret this as indicating that women would struggle with leadership and would not be able to rule with authority.

Support,religious protests against safe sex are causing an std epidemic.,"research shows that religious individuals are less likely to use condoms when they do engage in risky sexual behavior extramarital sex, for example , thus increasing risk of infection."
Attack,the earth is 70 water and humans have only explored 5 of this. more intelligent life potentially exists in the 95 we have not discovered.,"the entire ocean floor has been mapped . if there was a society of beings with intelligence equivalent to or greater than that of humans living down there, we would have found them by now."
Attack,"as men are often more aggressive than women p. 1032 , having more women in the military could reduce the number of criminal offenses committed against hostages, refugees, detainees, and prisoners.",women also participated in the torture and humiliation of prisoners in abu ghraib .
Attack,"a consumer is less likely to support a company that produces externalities, and the company is more likely to change or to fail because of this.","most consumers tend to consider the price more important than the sustainability of a product. not being environmentally sustainable as a company pays off, because it can typically produce and market products at a lower price than their environmentally sustainable competitor."
Attack,"unlike with faith that can make any unfalsifiable assertion that it wants to, scientific theories need be proven to be true.",in order to be consistent with the idea that only ideas which are falsifiable are scientific we cannot rule out supernatural or metaphysical causes as the claim that everything has a natural cause cannot be proven false and is therefore unscientific. the burden of proof for naturalism cannot be met. the fact that naturalism is given credit despite this fact reveals a prejudice which violates scientific principles. in short it's hypocrisy.
Attack,the persistence of two sexes in evolution suggests that we are complementary.,"being complimentary is not relevant to being better or worse. one can be complimentary and better, and vice versa."
Attack,"open source software can still make money, for example redhat which provides support for their systems.",redhat is a commercial linux provider. a truly open source os does not usually pay their developers.
Attack,"after the bankruptcy of lehman brothers, the korean won experienced a 19.2 depreciation against the us dollar p. 2 .","rigorous market intervention policies, such as those implemented in china and hong kong p. 3 , could have effectively averted exchange rate depreciation."
Support,"the prominent political scientist leopold kohr asserted that the primary cause of social misery including war, crime, and political corruption is an excessive size of the social unit.","kohr states that excessive size of the social unit leads to aggressive othering and dehumanisation of some demographics by others, because in a state of such magnitude it is impossible for all to be known to all."
Support,"most schools educate students in the exact same way , which is more likely to generate a homogeneous population. this is harmful to societal, and thereby individual, well being.",homogeneous societies are less diverse and more likely to socially stereotype people than comparatively heterogeneous societies. reduced diversity and increased stereotyping are both harmful to well being.
Attack,"william lane craig writes, as a member of the sanhedrin, which condemned jesus, joseph of arimathea is unlikely to be a christian invention. this is because he is depicted of caring for jesus's body well despite being a member of a group opposed to believers.","he could have been invented precisely to support the claim that jesus was buried in a tomb, rather than left on the cross to rot and for scavenging animals to eat, as was the standard roman practice."
Support,"women live longer because they take fewer risks , which render them less vulnerable to dangers and accidents.","women take fewer risks when it comes to their physical health e.g., lower rates of drinking and smoking , compared to men."
Attack,"in schools, there is often oversight and regulation to ensure that punishments are not excessive.","the line between appropriate punishment and abuse can be blurry or subjective, and therefore regulations are likely to be inadequate."
Support,"a space elevator is problematic for airplanes, because it hogs air space and provides a hazard for airplanes to crash into.","also, if airplanes crash into the space elevator, it could be costly for both the repairs and the affected cargo"
Attack,religions promote good behavior among their followers by providing them with common beliefs and goals.,"even if this is granted, the morality of misleading followers, intentionally or not can be in question. perhaps it is acceptable in some extreme cases. but when an individual is acting that out of norm, they are likely to behave badly even in the face of reward. even when they believe the reward is true."
Attack,in capitalism prices often obfuscate e.g. ecological cost and production work conditions.,it's not because it's often done that way that it needs to be
Attack,only with the normalisation of a practice through cultural appropriation does it become possible to celebrate and discuss the history of a culture or act.,"many different cultures are appropriated, and there is a lack of airtime and willingness to discuss them all in depth. this means some histories are likely to be ignored."

Attack,"if one asks what do animals detest, then the answer to that can be objective. this is basically how it can be objectively bad.","this is not relevant to what is objectively axiologically bad. in axiological terms, objective is never to be defined so loosely."
Attack,"information privacy , including the collection and dissemination of personal financial data, is recognized as an important fundamental human right across the world.",any individual's right to privacy must be balanced against the interests of the state in protecting the general social welfare.
Attack,"god exists because no other thing could have created the universe. god an infinite non physical being with values is the only thing possible to create the universe; because the alternative is an infinite physical counterpart without values such as the multiverse , and that is not possible to exist on its own without a cause, because it have to obey to the law of causality due to its physical nature.","the parent assumes a complete understanding of physics where none exists. it is an argument from ignorance that says, i don't know what made the universe so it must be god."
Support,"this is more on a singular timeline scale, the dc multiverse has more inner continuity with its lore.",the elseworlds events both cw and comic book take use of the multiverse to create such an elaborate story that still is continued to this day.
Support,"it shouldn't be like that. this problematic current situation is not really an argument against foss being better, it is an argument against foss development.",the existing options for financial support of open source development could be used more intensively and more extensive use of them could get encouraged and facilitated in various ways.
Support,"onan was killed for many reasons unrelated to contraception, not because of contraception.","onan had no intention of giving his brother s inheritance to any son of tamar s. he hoped by marrying tamar that he could gain er s inheritance, but he hoped that by having no children, the inheritance would not fall out of his hands. this violated a fundamental provision in the law of inheritance deut. 21:15 17 and was therefore a form of theft eighth commandment . part 4.1 ."
Support,the hierarchy within the catholic church exists partly to resolve any disputes over biblical interpretation.,"the local priest can provide members of the community with biblical guidance, even when those higher up in the structure of the catholic church have not commented on the specific matter."
Attack,"one of the most common ethical concepts is the golden rule: do to others what you would want done to you. murder, theft, rape, adultery, and lying are wrong, whereas respect, charity and protecting the weak are good because we look at these situations and consider how they would affect us if we were in them.","the impact of a given action on a given individual is going to depend on the circumstances of both the event and the individual. different environment personal history emotional status ... conditions will lead to either positive or negative perceptions of the same event. hence, there is no objective judgement from the affected person and hence, the extrapolation from such a hypothetical personal reaction is neither objective."
Support,turkish citizens would gain access to many new rights and privileges if made eu citizens.,eu citizenship would allow turkish citizens to work in any other member state without restrictions or discrimination.
Support,nvidia already has produced an ai that can make art out of simple drawings .,somebody has even attempted at making gaugan animate a couple of simple scenes .

Attack,it would cost a lot of money for the state to buy this art off private owners and collectors.,this would only be an upfront cost and would pay for itself in due course.
Attack,"males and females have different body characteristics that affect their ability to play sports, usually favoring men.",women are often able to perform better in sports like golf when compared to their male counterparts due to characteristics like greater flexibility.
Support,the qur'an advocates the use of violence against non believers .,"the prophet muhammad preached peace in mecca, but converted few. his later medina period produced exhortations to violence against non believers in the qur'an and hadith, and these are difficult to reconcile with the earlier teachings ."
Attack,claiming that the errors are caused by translation errors does not exonerate it. the book still contains factual errors.,"small errors that do not insubstantiate a claim that genesis is a crude, layman's interpretation of actual natural history. it puts light before earth, earth before plants, plants before animals and humans last. a remarkable coincidence if the writers were just making up a fairy tale."
Support,most evidence regarding qi and similar energy is anecdotal.,anecdotal evidence lacks the controlled environment necessary to isolate an accurate 'cause and effect'.
Support,"there are other , more important purposes of gaining an education than getting a job.",john dewey argued that the primary purpose of education is to prepare people to live pragmatically and immediately in their current environment.
Support,uap demonstrate flight characteristics and technological capabilities that are many iterations generations ahead of the best respective technologies humans have. they are also beyond the trajectory of any current aviation technology approach and seemingly defy known physics.,"navy pilot ryan graves as well as cmdr. dave fravor and lt. cmdr. alex dietrich , underwood , and other pilots reported having close encounters with such objects consistently reporting flight characteristics that are unlikely to be possible with human technology that were confirmed with radar data and have associated infrared camera data released and officially confirmed . there are reportedly many military witnesses of these vehicles and they were seen frequently."
Attack,"banning private schools would in effect translate to a ban on religious schools, a direct attack on religious freedoms.",forcing a child to spend over a decade in an educational institution with a religious atmosphere is an attack on their freedom to an unbiased education p. 8 .
Support,"many countries , including japan, germany, and russia, have declining populations. further limiting the population would exacerbate the problems of labor shortages and overburdened pensions that underpopulation already causes.",a parenting license will discourage people from having children. the birthrates in many developed countries are already far below the replacement fertility rate .
Attack,"humans have caused irreparable damage to the environment , which could be reduced and eventually reversed without them around anymore.",there are positive trends that suggest that the situation is improving without needing to resort to removing humans.
Attack,"boxing went from being one of the most popular sports in america to a niche sport, at least in part because of concern over the commonality of concussions. it is reasonable that the same will happen to football regardless of whether or not it is banned.","while boxing might have declined in popularity, mixed martial arts mma has soared in popularity. this suggests the public is perfectly comfortable with violence in sports."
Support,"high income countries tend to have low birth rates, often leading to ageing and shrinking populations p. 191 . low income countries tend to have higher birth rates , leading to a relatively youthful population. it makes economic sense to balance the ageing populations in richer economies by taking in young workers from countries with growing populations.","across almost all industrial nations, the share of the population at working age 15 64 is expected to decline significantly in the coming decades p. 14 ."
Support,it is morally wrong to contribute to enriching an individual who regularly engages in discriminatory attacks against members of a vulnerable community.,supporting such people empowers them to engage in more discriminatory actions.

Attack,"the emission of semen in leviticus 15:16 is specifically an involuntary nocturnal emission, which means that it is not necessarily in the same category as deliberate contraception .","the verb indicating a spilling outside ת צ א in verse 16 is in the qal stem, indicating an active tense rather than a passive tense. this parallels the active tense for intercourse י שׁ כּ ב that is used in verse 18."
Support,"the original hyde amendment allowed exceptions in cases where the mother's life was in danger p. 1434 . the exceptions have since been expanded, and many states now allow the use of federal funds for abortions in cases of life endangerment, rape, or incest .","thirty three us states and the district of columbia follow the established federal guidelines and provide state funds for abortion in cases of life endangerment, rape and incest."

Attack,"as the vast majority of individuals want to avoid their lives being taken, it is very likely that the death penalty works as an effective deterrent.",most criminals do not assume that they will be caught for their crimes.
Support,"in some execution methods, multiple people are involved in the process, but not all of them are the true executioner that is left to mystery in order to relieve their ethical concerns.","in a firing squad, one of the marksmen is usually given a blank cartridge . this leaves the shooters with some peace of mind that they may not have fired the lethal shot."
Attack,"moderation rather than prohibition should suffice; for any population level there is, mathematically speaking, an amount of meat that can be sustainably consumed e.g., each person eating meat twice per week might be sustainable for 7 billion people .",the practice and habit of moderation is much more difficult to follow successfully than simple abstention.
Attack,priests are likely to be good fathers and husbands as they understand that how they behave in their home should reflect biblical teachings.,some biblical teachings are likely to harm children.

Support,the available open source software may not meet the needs of the government.,"many web applications, mobile apps, and hardware software that they use are not open source. examples include x for public communication, kialo in schools, or firmware and drivers for required or already present hardware. for many of such cases, there are no viable open source alternatives."

Attack,"america has already taken a stance against settlements in the west bank and, therefore, does not need to recognise palestine as a state.","the us has been unable to stop israel from expanding settlements, so it must do more to ensure their ally respects international law."
Attack,a socialist economy would most probably raise the price of necessity items as there would be less need based competition.,"socialist economies will try to own the means of production or service creation but the final routes to market, the consumer can be through a myriad of means often competing. in the final phases closer to the consumer there will be competition to keep prices down."
Support,"genetically modified crops reduce the use of pesticides, herbicides, fertilisers, and other chemical additives.","insect resistance genes can be inserted into crops from other species, negating the need for insecticide whilst also protecting crops."

Support,pharmacists were rated as one of of the most trusted professionals in the united states in 2016.,pharmacists are trusted because they are clinically trained medication experts who can answer patients questions and offer advice about their medications.

Attack,teaching communication skills and emotional self regulation to students will help to ensure their success in the world after graduation.,teaching practical skills in theory without practical application is unlikely to see significant results.
Support,these numbers tell us very little about the circumstances and difficulties these non meat eaters face.,"by the same logic, the estimated 5 of china's population that are christians would not face many problems. yet more than half of them are organized in semi legal underground churches, which exemplifies the difficulties they face."
Attack,a person can have a say in how taxes are spent by voting for a representative who aligns with their desired allocation of funds.,"majority rule, making decisions based on preferences of the majority, may devolve into mob rule and not adequately protect minority rights."
Attack,"a group may be larger or more powerful than another and still be relevant to moral decision making. to say otherwise risks people being treated punitively for circumstances they did not create, and limits their personal freedoms to enjoy a culture in any way they want.",people from the original culture may have a more intense preference for gatekeeping than an outsider has for engaging in a cultural practice it is important to respect the intensity of that preference.
Support,there is no case for altering animals' biology when plant based meat analogues are so realistic that many carnists can't tell the difference.,"beyond meat , for example, is a plant based meat substitute that cooks and looks much like beef. it has already garnered interest from vegans and meat eaters alike."

Attack,the legal availability of addictive substances leads more people to use them than when they are banned or regulated.,"black markets will meet the demand for these substances even if they are illegal, therefore causing addiction to still be a major problem."

Attack,"homosexuality is considered as a grave sin in christianity, the largest religion in the world.",see discussion 18187: the bible does not support the conclusion that homosexuality is a sin against god.
Attack,this argument is continuing the prior strawman in that it wasn't argued that people are prevented from eating meat.,"repeating the assertion that the one topic is a strawman, does not affect whether there are two different topics being switched between, so this does not address the argument."
Attack,"a study conducted on a large cohort of circumcised males showed that foreskin is important for penile sensitivity, overall sexual satisfaction, and penile functioning.","the effect size quoted in this study is too small to be clinically meaningful, which makes their conclusions tenuous at best."
Support,religious teachings that appear contradictory may be expressing truths that exceed the rational capacity of humans p. 1061 .,human understanding is inherently limited to the extent of human perceptions and ability to process information.
Support,"certain principles can still be applied in a modern context. given that millions of people are members of religions which take lessons from centuries old texts, they can have certain modern implications.",a core aspect of the islamic belief is that the quran and all its teaching are eternally relevant. hence muslims still abide by most of these teachings.
Support,countries in which abortion is available have similar abortion rates to countries in which abortion is illegal.,comparing countries with and without legal abortion shows that legalisation of abortion does not increase the rate at which people undergo the procedure.

Attack,"the thing that the jewish leaders expected the guards to say, his disciples came during the night and stole him away while we were asleep , is a weak cover story because the guards would not have known that the body was stolen specifically by the disciples if the guards were sleeping at the time. the priests would have been smarter than to offer this cover story .",the leaders probably included the disciples specifically in their cover story because who else would steal the body? reasonablefaith.org
Support,"foods already contain fluoride , so eating those will allow fluoride to attach onto teeth.","black tea, spinach, raisins and potatoes are examples of foods that naturally contain fluoride."

Attack,"a head of state with the absolute power to pardon themself for crimes, including those of which they are convicted , is one of the hallmarks of a dictatorship, so self pardons should be banned.","the belief that the presidential power to pardon is absolute is misguided. when a pardon violates criminal laws, federal prosecutors and congress are empowered to take action."
Attack,school uniforms can prevent the wearing of gang related imagery or colors.,school uniforms are much less effective than other preventative practices against gang violence.
Attack,humans in a society gain rights by the virtue of duties they have. animals are unable to fulfill duties and therefore cannot enjoy the rights attached to them.,"animals are responsible for important social tasks as well, e.g. guide dogs or therapy animals. humans depend on animals with this functions."
Attack,"given that the primary purpose of some women only spaces is to enable women to feel safer or more comfortable, the perception of risk, whether justified or not, is a real issue.",women should find a way to cope with such feelings in a way that does not hamper the right of trans women to use these spaces.
Support,this would also provide a lot of personal information that isn't necessarily the evidence law enforcement was looking for.,"for example, a data dump of a person's personal messages might reveal medical information."

Attack,the generation of hypotheses and the subjects and directions of scientific inquiry are limited by the extent of human awareness.,"scientific inquiry has led to expanded human awareness, including many phenomena that cannot be directly perceived by human senses. for example, scientists have posited the existence of dark energy to explain certain phenomena despite the lack of observable evidence for its existence."
Support,"under us law, religious education is forbidden in public schools, except from a neutral, academic perspective . therefore, if gender identity and sexual orientation are taught, they should be done in a way that includes all perspectives.","if a teacher or school administration endorses one perspective of religion, it is considered an infringement of the establishment clause of the first amendment."
Attack,mandatory vaccines would infringe upon individuals' human rights.,human rights are contingent on the protection of other people's safety. not vaccinating is unsafe for yourself and others.
Support,the government is not synonymous with the people .,"as the us is a representative democracy , as opposed to a system of direct democracy, there is a level of disconnect between the government and the people."
Support,"in some eu countries, unemployment benefits are time limited, therefore recipients cannot rely on them indefinitely.","most targeted unemployment benefits have time limitations. across europe, only belgium guarantees unlimited unemployment benefits. in other countries the benefits last from 3 to 24 months for a worker with 22 years of contributions european commission, pg. 5 ."
Support,abortion can be used as a preventative measure to prevent a child from a life of suffering.,over 40 of america s homeless population suffer from disabilities whereas only 17.7 of the general population do . choosing to abort a disabled child could contribute to decreasing the homeless population and prevent suffering of the child caused by homelessness and poverty.

Support,christopher hitchens publicly identified a number of hypocritical and evil beliefs and practices.,hitchens discussed how children can be irreparably harmed by their parents' religious teachings p. 816 .
Attack,"president trump's pardon of sheriff joe arpaio, who was a hero to the trump base , has been regarded by many as an unethical abuse of executive power .","trump and arpaio were political bedfellows , as evidenced by how similarly the two men ran their respective offices. thus, national support for trump in the form of a presidential victory, was implicit support for arpaio, who publicly endorsed him."
Attack,"in 1834, britain abolished slavery, freeing over 800,000 african slaves.",abolition does not exonerate the perpetration of slavery.
Attack,"without demand for pornography, unethical adult content would not exist.","this is no different from the argument that if there was no religion, there would be no religious discrimination; the fact that unethical versions of something exist is not proof that the thing itself is inherently unethical."
Attack,"while opposing the ordination of women, pope francis is increasingly concerned with figuring out ways to honour the importance of women in the catholic church.","there is nothing commendable about a male authority marginally expanding the limits to which women can participate in an institution. unless this power imbalance is rectified by appointing female leaders and ensuring equal opportunity, such leaders can be considered part of the oppressive system."
Support,same sex oriented individuals face more discrimination and condemnation than others.,same sex oriented individuals are more likely to be victims of violent crimes.
Attack,"an actual argument that extinction risk is near zero from human made ai would be nice, and seems required in support of a claim that the statement on ai risk should refer to space aliens instead.","this is complete misinterpretation of a concise claim it does not argue that it should refer to space aliens instead , it states that the largest source of potential extinction risk would be from extraterrestrial origin beings deploying or exploiting ai systems. this does not mean that it would only refer to this risk, but that this is considered among the risks."
Attack,"there is no clear understanding of the technical or structural limitations of liquid democracy and it is therefore unclear whether it is a step away from, or toward tyranny.",liquid democracy is a step away from tyranny because it fundamentally puts more power in the hands of people.
Attack,reforming the security council may be challenging and any attempts to change the current structure could lead to a breakdown in cooperation.,"that literally proves the point. it should be abolished, because, the five nations have consistently abused their power to lead to a breakdown in cooperation us shielding israel from sanctions, china and russia blocking sanctions during the darfur genocide, uk and france helping to perpetuate the suez crisis"
Attack,"there is no guarantee that a foetus that remains in the womb will develop into a baby since, regrettably, miscarriages occur.","the potential for something to happen unintentionally e.g. miscarriage does not mean it's ok to make it happen intentionally e.g. abortion . it is as strange as to say: someone walking might stumble, that's why it's ok to push this person to make them stumble."
Support,"given the susceptibility of children to social influence , children's access to gender affirming treatment must be limited until it is clear that they are not opting in to transitioning due to peer pressure.","adolescents are more strongly influenced by same age peers than by the opinions of adults. given that an increasing number of young people are coming out as transgender , this is likely to affect them."
Support,proponents of pc view it as an aspect of human rights . people who support basic human rights and champion their viewpoint are not detrimental to society.,"not being pc violates article 1 of udhr , all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. they are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood."
Support,"young adult literature is often written by, and for, people whose experiences are more diverse and varied than those captured in traditional literary canons.",young people feel increasingly ignored in modern society. sculpting novels for young adults allows them to be fairly recognized in modern literature.
Attack,"wikipedia is generally not meant to present scientific knowledge in its whole complexity, for example with explanations of the methodology that underlies results.",many wikipedia entries include links to more detailed sources. scientists would likely understand the importance of adding credible references to their contributions. in this way scientists could provide sources for those who want to go beyond a general introduction on that topic.
Support,the majority of developed criminal legal systems hold this expectation of proof. that guilt must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt not without any doubt at all .,"a classic analogy is that if god is accused of being guilty of existing, the jury must be convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that he is guilty, otherwise innocence nonexistence is assumed"
Attack,"single sex schools may not have the resources and expertise to support intersex and gender fluid students' unique needs, which can hinder their academic and personal development.","single sex schools already include intersex students and gender fluid students who pass, present, or identify as the gender they admit. this proves that there are no needs unique to intersex and gender fluid students that single sex schools are unable to address."
Support,uses of proskuneo in the septuagint that are preceded by a reference to bowing down consistently mean worship.,"genesis 24:48 says, i bowed down and worshiped the lord..."

Support,according to hebrew religion jesus did not meet any of the requirements to be the messiah,jesus was not anointed according to scriptural standards .
Attack,many people who believe in the supernatural have no mental health issues .,believers might deny their mental health challenges because religion causes people to undermine genuine mental health concerns.
Support,"iran is interested in building a new silk road trading route that runs from central asia to the persian gulf, which could best flourish in a peaceful afghanistan.","a us withdrawal and significant reduction of support to the current government of afghanistan would reorient iran s approach to its neighbor to the east. iran would likely find it in its own interest to cease its support to the taliban , with which it has factional tensions, and lend support to the afghan government, or to broker a settlement between the two."
Attack,"palestine is currently too weak to prevent settler expansion militarily, and as such the us should intervene to mitigate this on their behalf.","even if no new settlements are built, it is hard to imagine how the 800,000 jewish settlers already living on palestinian land could be removed."

Attack,"whatever one's interpretation of the objects in question may be, nobody is debating the presence of monuments and memorials that point out the confederate leaders' defeat as their primary feature.","most monuments depict a man, not showing victory or defeat. people are attaching their own meanings to these monuments and then claim it is their primary feature."
Attack,the racial justice act was repealed in 2013 by governor pat mccrory.,the repeal of the racial justice act was found to be unconstitutional by the north carolina supreme court.
Attack,adding a god with no explanation for his existence as the explanation for the universe only pushes the problem back a step without solving it. it is a simpler hypothesis to stop one step earlier. thus we can cut off god with occam's razor.,god exists by the necessity of his own nature. under premise 1 of the leibniz cosmological argument to exist by necessity of ones own nature is still an explanation.
Support,it accelerates science because scientists can build upon reused code from others or extend existing software or examine the code of projects and so on. this concerns scientific software but also software more generally if it is indirectly related to scientific progress .,"this allows replicating studies, which is important in science, as is being able to readily understand how exactly results were achieved."
Attack,continued israeli occupation of the west bank prevents the authoritarian islamist group hamas from taking over the area.,the occupation of the west bank fuels anti israel sentiment and promotes hamas.
Support,"zoos should be preserved, but required to only have animals that are injured or cannot be released back into the wild. these animal ambassadors can educate and endear the public, while minimizing cruelty to animal species.",to ban zoos is to end the paradox that modern zoos live nowadays. they re organizations with a mandate to support conservation and education of the public regarding wild animals and nature that also manage captive wildlife.

'missing time' which has been blocked 7. certain practices like sex or examinations and hybrid like children 8. certain health impacts.",getting levitated is something reported by many abductees.
Attack,"that water somehow gets to the sky in order to come back down is by no means a remarkable belief for an ancient person to have. but the passage clearly shows that the author doesn't know it understand how the water gets to heaven and so ascribes the phenomenon to an act of divine intervention, while the other behaviors of water are not ascribed to god but merely to the elements e.g. the clouds, not god pour down their moisture . thus, the passage doesn't exhibit any knowledge of evaporation.",the old testament also describes god as the one who sends down rain.
Support,"an ai model could be more easily customized and adjusted to censor certain information or be un biased in certain ways that could be considered problematic. that may not be possible, or not as easily possible, with proprietary ais by companies.",the default deepseek model appears to censor various information.

Attack,"nudity in advertising is commonplace in europe . yet, there have not been any harmful effects on sexuality more broadly.","contrary to the long held myth, sex doesn't sell . a sexy photo might draw attention to the ad, but it doesn't make people more likely to purchase the product."
Support,"religion concerns topics not covered in history, so it cannot be taught comprehensively in a history class.","it is impossible to understand global politics , now or at any time in history, without understanding the importance of religion."
Attack,ai would tend to take decisions that benefit from its understanding the most humans without being able to distinguish between moral and ethics that are linked to human emotion . this could lead to authoritarianism.,this is mainly a technical problem of the algorithm rule set that is used in the ai and as such is solvable.
Attack,"friendship, like voting, depends on the voluntary consent of all parties involved. if one party is forced to participate against their will, then the friendship is compromised.","mandatory voting would not have the same effect on societal participation that mandatory friendship would have on social relationships, as voting and friendship are not analogous."
Support,"as public education already includes subjects that cover ever changing topics, such as science, teaching about gender identity and sexual orientation could also be covered with the same lens.","same gender attraction was depathologized by the scientific community only in 1973. yet, current scientific opinion is that attraction toward members of the same gender is perfectly normal."
Support,"in many cases, adults can be saved more easily than children. in these cases, the life of the adult should be priortised over the child as this will likely maximise the amount of life being saved.","in time sensitive crisis situations, it may be difficult to get children to understand what is happening and what needs to be done. this increases the risk of not saving the child as well as an adult who would have otherwise been rescued within the same time frame."
Attack,"these documents can also be amended, and yet no amendment has even been proposed on water as a right.","current us legislation is made progressively less with its citizens in mind; thus, it would not grant these rights, especially when major water consumers such as nestle hold massive control over these supplies ."

Attack,global cultural diversity is beneficial and is significantly improved when high income countries accept refugees.,"if a high income country takes in many refugees from vastly different cultural backgrounds who do not share its traditions and values, this may threaten the host nation's entire cultural identity."
Attack,"this argument is a double edged sword. if the boycott signifies that muslims will not allow their lives to be interfered with, then any retaliatory measure from the french government and people should be taken as a message that they will not allow their french way of life to be interfered with.","the muslim identity is an integral part of the french identity, especially for the generation of people born in france who are descendants of those from france's former colonies in north africa."
Support,the uncertainty of future supplies of fossil fuels means that those countries which adopt non carbon technology will have an economic edge in the coming years.,a growth of fossil free energy supplies has already given sweden an edge in some manufacturing sectors.
Attack,it is a misconception that gun owners are opposed to stricter regulation; there is evidence that the majority of gun owners favor additional restrictions .,a number of rural counties remain staunchly opposed to any gun control legislation and have declared themselves sanctuaries for the ownership of forbidden guns.
Attack,the worldwide resource drain is not due to overpopulation but mass consumerism.,consumerism is so ingrained in people that it would likely be easier to reduce the population than to get people to consume less.
Attack,"it is immoral to force those who, through no choice of their own, were born into a specific position within a capitalist society, and who lack either the will, the ability, or both to meaningfully participate within it, particularly when the options to leave are linked to the position of birth, and are more platitude than reality. those with the volition and ability to participate in dominant culture add to that domination, and therefore hold personal responsibility towards those less capable.","it is immoral to force those who, through no choice of their own, were born into a specific position within a welfare society, who lack either the will, the ability, or both to meaningfully participate within it etc., etc."
Support,"school uniforms enforce stereotypes and gender roles, which can be harmful for students.",uniforms can present a real challenge to students who are unsure of their gender identity or who want to experiment with different forms of gender presentation.
Attack,"people are only able to physically watch one tv channel at a time. while people without cable have fewer options, they are still able to access some form of programming.","the variety and diversity of channels available is the issue, not how many can be watched at once."
Attack,"platforms should highlight potentially false claims and encourage users to undertake their own fact checking, rather than spoon feeding them government condoned sources.","government condoned sources are commonly well researched and reviewed, and as such are reliable sources of information."
Support,the concept of god can be derived by extrapolating from existing knowledge.,"just as we can extrapolate from our existing knowledge to obtain an idea of the future without it necessarily being accurate, so too might we extrapolate from things that we know about the world to the idea of a divine creator without that idea necessarily being accurate."
Attack,"in order to create a politically united europe, it will be necessary for countries to adopt similar political systems and abolish monarchies.",the european union has never proposed any pro presidency or anti monarchy rules for its member states.
Support,faith shouldn't be considered at all in order to determine if you are worthy or not.,"faith is not something that can be forced, and it would be unfair for god to weigh up his children based on something they cannot control."
Support,the attack by bb 8 is too convenient a narrative contrivances and as such interferes with suspension of disbelief. the plot development makes a hitherto unaggressive character into the greatest warrior of the resistance.,"additionally, this development overshadows the heroism and resourcefulness of other characters."
Attack,"with no incentive not to employ violence to achieve status or wealth, individuals who are more capable of violence than the general population will be incentivised to do so. the population is then incentivised to be more violent and form alliances for mutual protection, which produces a feedback loop of escalating violence.",this is a fantasy of violence levels and chaos that wouldn't exist within a relatively peacefully established society of anarchism.
Attack,"this is still a form of discrimination, which does not promote equality. it doesn't even promote equity.","given that women form the larger numbers of the population, this is proportionate and hence equitable."
Attack,"if time was circular, some event e would have to be before itself and after itself at the same time. this is absurd.","it only seems absurd from a naiive point of view. in fact, closed timelike curves or jinn particles are possibilities seriously considered by physicists."
Support,"in cases of pregnancy due to rape, terminating the life of the unborn child will not correct the horror done to the woman. it will simply pass on the act of force to an innocent party.",responsibility cannot be transferred for harm to another person. the person responsible for the abortion is the one making the decision.
Support,mass immigration increases the competition for jobs and lowers wages. this serves big companies but not the employed poor and middle class people.,"majority of immigrants are low skilled, in the uk only last year scrapping the cap for high skilled migrants was discussed 20,700 per year despite immigration from outside the eu being on level around 300,000 per year for a long time."
Attack,christian churches in the us condemn the introduction of gender neutral bathrooms.,"the bible does not explicitly address the need for gender segregated bathrooms; therefore, church condemnation of such a policy is not theologically justified."
Attack,"accessible bathrooms can be designed so as to render caregiver assistance unnecessary, negating the need for gender neutral bathrooms.","poorly designed accessible bathrooms may still require caregiver assistance for entry and exit, in which cases gender neutral bathrooms would be preferable."
Attack,trans women may not experience certain biological processes that cis women experience.,the need for bathroom access is a universal human experience.
Attack,just because something potentially becomes a problem in the future does not alone require it to stop today.,"because of the anticipation of scarce resources in the future, we ought to begin conserving resources now by stopping meat consumption."
Support,homeschooling education can be adapted to cater to a child's specific needs. traditional schools must cater to the needs of the entire class.,boys are often harmed by traditional school environments and could benefit from the additional attention in homeschool set ups.
Support,"by probability theory, we can prove that p m e p m p e . rearranging, we then have p e p m p m e . thus, as miracles are unlikely, they require comparably improbable evidence in order to make them likely.","by probability theory we can also prove that p k j p k p j . rearranging we have p j p k p k j thus, as unlikely as it is that a particular author would justify their claims, it would require that author to know what they are even talking about."
Attack,"david's sons were allowed to be priests 2 samuel 8:18 , but this is forbidden numbers 3:10 , 16:40 .",the verse should be translated david's sons were over the priests.
Support,school uniforms are required and enforced more often for students of color.,"only 1 in 20 white students in atlanta attended schools that required uniforms, while almost half of black students did."
Support,bad actors can sabotage the discussion and skew the results.,even people with good intentions can spread false information inadvertently.
Support,"any space reserved exclusively for women is a safe space by default, as it excludes men who could potentially harm them.",the increased attention focused on any man attempting to access a women only space acts as a deterrent to crime.
Support,"even if more priests are recruited, they will not necessarily be evenly geographically distributed.","priests are incardinated to a diocese, meaning they will remain in the same place that they trained to be a priest, so areas with low numbers of priests could still exist."
Support,americans tend to think that they are more important than the others. this is simply wrong.,"research showed that most us americans think that they are superior to everyone else. a central feature of moral superiority, also known as self enhancement, is irrational thinking."
Attack,"the universe is ordered. the number of ways a universe could exist as an ordered thing are finite, but the number of ways it could exist as a random thing are infinite. therefore, our ordered universe's existence is infinitely improbable if there is nothing external to the universe which is responsible for it being ordered. it is, therefore, probable that such a thing exists, and this we call god.",you can't determine the probability of something without a numerator and denominator. you must have access to all possible universes to make such claims. our universe shows a high degree of disorder as it is. you don't get to just shove something external to our universe into the argument without demonstrating it.
Attack,the spoiler effect is much less of a problem in irv than in plurality.,voters are often incorrectly told that irv solves eliminates vote splitting spoiler effect. this is misleading and leads voters to believe the problem is solved when it isn't. when a spoiler happens anyways voters can lose faith in voting reform in general which could backfire and hurt future reforms.
Attack,god used the trials of job to reveal more about god to the world.,"what this revealed was god's need to impress satan and his willingness to cause harm to achieve his own goals. that is the actions of an oppressor, to show dominion over and willingness to harm those beneath him, in order to send a message that he is greater than they are."
Attack,"large portions of the bible previously taken as history have been demonstrated to be at best incredibly unlikely to have happened. an example is the exodus story which is now thought to never have happened. here is an introduction to the topic . over time less and less of the bible has been able to be taken literally, so though some small portions may hold some truth over all the narrative holds little to no credibility.",see 1.1.1.2.2.1.2.4.1.10.5.1.3.1.1.2.1.7.1.1.1.1.6.
Support,one's first amendment right does not confer a duty on others to listen.,there are strong arguments for the us courts to recognise a first amendment right against compelled listening .
Support,the top 10 of earners in the usa pay over half of all federal income tax even though they account for only 45 of all income.,"a salary cap would primarily hit those with an income of over 250,000 per year. this group currently includes only about 3 of tax payers, yet accounts for more than half of all income tax paid which equals about a quarter of all federal government revenue."
Support,"the gospel of nicodemus was written in the fourth century ce, long after the gospels and epistles, and is not accepted as canonical.","this indicates that the figure of nicodemus gained interest several hundreds of years after the gospels were written, not that the historical nicodemus actually played a significant role in the early church."
Attack,it must also be considered that cause and effect could be reversed here. there could be many people with violent tendencies or desires who work in slaughterhouses in an attempt to give that violence a safer outlet.,"regardless of this, it is still possible that working in slaughterhouses could exacerbate pre existing violent tendencies."
Support,a structured career path reduces psychological problems faced by those pursuing the career.,those facing career path problems are more likely to suffer from anxiety or depression .
Attack,the increase in time in front of computer screens that might come about from adding coding classes to the curriculum can be offset by cutting back on other forms of screen time.,it is hard for parents and schools to enforce restrictions; children can normally find ways around them.
Support,sects in religions may deepen their divides to a point where one might find opposing moral practices being preached within a single religion.,"christianity, for instance is divided by issues such as the nature of jesus, the authority of apostolic succession, biblical hermeneutics, theology, and papal primacy."
Attack,it is a well established historical fact that both james jesus brother and paul formerly known as saul were both skeptics of jesus resurrection and were both converted to faith in jesus. these conversions would not have taken place on such little evidence as a missing body.,paul was convinced not by physical evidence but by a personal vision.
Support,"many old researches are required to adapt to changes and, therefore, are likely to do so.",medical practitioners are required to stay up to date with sometimes rapidly evolving medical practices.
Attack,"researchers found that the marriage structure shaped men's attitudes, beliefs and behaviors toward women in the workplace. imposing gender quotas will not address these root causes of workplace sexism rendering them counter productive.","using quotas to help place qualified women in boardroom positions will help normalise their presence there, thus undermining the stereotyped belief that only men hold positions of authority in both the home and workplace."
Support,man made carbon emissions are likely to protect humans from another ice age .,"during the last four ice ages, co2 concentration has been dangerously low falling below 190 ppm. in the most recent ice age, it fell to 182 ppm. below 150 ppm, most terrestrial plant life cannot exist ."
Attack,"many schools have community based events like tailgates and parties before or after football games, which are essential for the enjoyment of students and their college experience.",tailgating is associated with excessive drinking and other dangerous activities.
Support,evil can coexist with a monotheistic god that is not omnibenevolent.,an amoral god would not preclude the existence of evil.
Support,the accounts of noah's life and the flood narrative within old testament are at odds with each other.,"nephilim existed before the flood genesis 6:4 , and the flood killed all life not on the ark genesis 7:21 , yet there were nephilim after the flood as well numbers 13:33 ."
Support,this is what obama meant when he said you didn't build this. he was talking about the infrastructure that corporations didn't create but fully utilize in pursuit of profits.,a great idea may take off in america but have no chance of success in a 3rd world country that lacks basic services.
Attack,the parent assumes substance dualism to be false and thus makes an unwarranted assumption.,dualism is false or unproven. there is no evidence of the mind being any more than what the brain does.
Support,"due to gender specific barriers , some genders are disproportionately represented in different fields. removing gender from society would legitimize blindness to these barriers and exacerbate these disparities.","in the absence of a level playing field, gender blindness can lead to a failure to provide accommodations for gender specific needs and challenges."
Support,"group therapy is most effective in the presence of at least one licensed therapist, the presence of which is rare on internet forums. a licensed therapist can help sufferers identify and challenge harmful assumptions and beliefs.","given the complexities of eating disorders, eating disorder therapists who specialize in the treatment of eating disorders are important guides in the recovery process."
Attack,"many countries allow minors to make significant life decisions, such as those relating to their reproductive choices.","even if minors are conferred the right to transition, they are not financially independent enough to pay for gender affirming procedures. as such, they cannot truly exercise this right until they become financially independent adults."
Attack,there is significant public opposition to privatization.,the public are unhappy with the way the nhs is currently functioning.
Support,"women have a positive image in society, especially with regard to their strength and capabilities. this does not need to be changed.","one of the primary purposes of the military is to engage in warfare , which is a means of destruction. in contrast, women are linked to the creation of life."
Attack,finland has not been invaded since the 1939 1940 russo finnish war .,"according to putin , the world is currently going through the most dangerous decade since the 1940s. perhaps this implies another invasion of finland is likely."
Support,"the movie sets up and launches the star wars series beyond what was established in the original and prequel trilogies in terms of its narratives, themes, and plot.",the last jedi is unexpected. defying fan expectations is risky and exactly what a franchise needs.
Support,"the finnish economy is highly industrialised and rich, making it resilient to russian economic attacks.","in the event of russian economic retaliation, finland would also have support from its nato allies, which would blunt the efficacy of such sanctions."
Attack,"since zionists also believe they have an exclusive right to the region, either belief cannot be deemed valid if peace is to be achieved.",this has been a characteristic of right wing zionism; liberal zionism has long abandoned the goal of an exclusively jewish state .
Support,"tourism creates low skilled jobs, helping the poor and vulnerable.","since tourism is labor intensive , jobs are unlikely to be lost because of automation."
Support,"limiting the capabilities of ai is to limit our own welfare, given that we would have a tool that operates below its maximum performance.",the purpose for developing ai is partially negated by imposing artificial limitations on an ai's thought.
Attack,pope francis has increased division in the catholic church.,"pope francis has reached out to many subsets of the church, as well as other christian organizations, to improve relations."
Support,"much remains unknown about why mother teresa did the things she did. however, as previously unknown information emerges, her motivations appear benevolent, affirming her sainthood.","mother teresa was criticized for supposedly endorsing hoxha. however, hoxha had caused her great grief by not allowing her to enter the country to visit her family; yet, at the behest of his widow, she visited his grave and prayed for his forgiveness ."
Attack,"non human animals can't judge what is valuable or not. if only humans are capable of such evaluations, then only human evaluation can be considered.","it cannot be said with certainty that non humans can't judge value, since we do not have a proper way of communicating with other species."
Attack,"since luke first held the lightsaber in star wars 1977, the viewers have discovered that that same weapon was used to murder an entire tribe of sandpeople and, following that, a room full of children. considering the history of the weapon as the viewer now knows it it is appropriate to the viewer that the character discards it.",the slaughter of the younglings was the only incontrovertible occasion that the lightsaber was used for evil purposes. it has been used far more often in the name of good.
Attack,"in the latter half of the 20th century, some theologians began advocating secular christianity.",that some theologians believe a thing doesn't make it part of christianity itself or its orthodoxy.
Support,an agi would offer an intelligent non human viewpoint on a variety of issues.,"humans always seek greater self understanding, which agi could provide."
Support,vertical farming could lower the spread of foodborne illnesses.,"11 of foodborne illnesses come from lettuce. since vertical farms specialize in lettuce , they could reduce diseases stemming overall greatly just from this crop alone."
Attack,many religions provide moral guidance in the form of divine revelation.,"religions only provide moral guidance in the form of testimonies of divine revelation, and these are unprovable, fabricatable, and subject to degradation of memory over time."
Attack,"president trump did not demonstrate the managerial ability to build and maintain a stable administrative team around him, which reflected negatively on him as a president.","it is unclear whether his managerial style showed good judgment, as there were two completely different stories on the goings on in the white house. a negative picture was painted by anonymous people or people with little credibility , while a positive picture was painted by everyone else who worked or had worked there."
Attack,"laws in states such as the uk require that animals be stunned before being killed, so as to be totally unconscious and thus incapable of feeling pain at the time of their slaughter.","these same laws around pre stunning do not apply to shechita jewish and halal muslim slaughter of animals for meat, whose methods usually involve cutting the animal s throat with a very sharp knife, often without pre stunning."
Support,life involves pain and suffering. people that are aware of this and still choose to bring a life into the world are acting out of selfish desire.,"children can be adopted, but when people choose to have them it shows that their desire to continue their genetic line overpowers their desire to merely raise a child."
Support,the foster care system would improve in a world where parenting licenses were required.,foster parents and foster care home staff would likely be required to have a parenting license.
Support,intelligent design does not follow the scientific method . it relies on untestable claims and does not provide sufficient evidence for its claims.,there are a swath of valid scientific critcism of intelligent design which is why it is not consider as scientific and has failed as several legal challenges to be considered as such.
Support,"the risk to humanity of agi is existential . as such, no benefits could outweigh such terminal risks.","in order to combat rogue ai, humans might need to shut down devices powerful enough to be used by ai, which would be catastrophic."
Attack,"if it is not possible to assess someone's interest at a distance, it is best to assume they are not interested, rather than approach them and risk inferring a burden onto them.","assuming someone is not interested may lead to a lost opportunity in meeting a compatible person, or having an enjoyable sexual experience."
Attack,"unpopular policies could have adverse effects on the city , making implementation by the city government immoral.",it would be equally immoral for a government to ignore the potential benefits of banning cars on the health of citizens and the environment.
Support,"the crucifixion of jesus, which fulfills prophecies such as psalm 22, isaiah 53, and zechariah 12:10, is attested by non christian sources, making it unlikely that this detail was made up by the evangelists to fit the prophecies.","mara bar serapion writes, for what benefit did the athenians obtain by putting socrates to death, ... or the jews by the murder of their wise king, ... the wise king is a reference to jesus."
Support,"the us, as a political entity, did not set up these confederate memorials. they were, instead, erected by cities and or states, respectively.","for example, frederick, maryland has a statue of native son justice roger taney, who authored the infamous dred scott decision. frederick's statue of taney reflects its unique history, which should not be displaced by the nation as a whole."
Attack,"government monopolies are not necessarily a bad thing, when their primary goal is not to maximise shareholder capital but rather to maximise citizens' living standards.","per the iron law of bureaucracy , the goal of organisations tends to be the persistence of that organisation; so governments' primary goal is not to maximise citizens' living standards."
Support,public satisfaction is partly falling due to the lack of funding in the nhs.,"since 2014 jeremy hunt , the health and social care secretary, has taken 4.3bn from the nhs in england s capital budget."
Support,"god's anger lasts forever towards those who do not repent, but it goes away towards those who do.",in jeremiah 3:12 13 acknowledging guilt is treated as a condition for god's anger to go away.
Attack,"daniel 9:25 says that from the going forth of the commandment to restore and to build jerusalem , which began by 444 bc , there will be seven and sixty two weeks literally 'sevens' before messiah the prince. this refers to the 7 62 7 483 years starting no later than 444 bc when the messiah will come, which lines up well with jesus's coming.","assuming the date 444 bce is correct for the beginning, 483 years from then would be 39 ce, a date of no real significance, as jesus had died nearly a decade or so earlier. thus, jesus doesn't even fulfill the prophecy under that assumption."
Support,certain drugs simply can not be consumed in a safe manner.,"heroin causes harm to the body, especially when it is cut with dangerous substances."
Support,removal is the most drastic measure when there are more gentle alternatives.,"balance is key. in the us, there are more than 1,500 monuments to the confederacy , including plaques and place names. approximately 1,000 can be removed or moved to museums, leaving around 500 for historical reference. society should not attempt to glorify the confederacy by the sheer quantity, but the past should never be erased either."
Support,"scientific facts are based on defined, measurable parameters .","measurable parameters rely on mathematics , which is independent of our subjective thoughts and perspectives."
Attack,"the chinese room thought experiment demonstrates functionalism to be false. the chinese room with the person inside would simulate a computer to an outside person and represents a functionalist account of mental states like thinking and understanding meaning. for a person outside, the room receives input and gives output in a way that makes it appear that the room understands chinese. but all the room really does is imitate mental understanding. it does not possess it.","mental understanding is not a well defined or understood process. therefore, it is unjustified to declare that the room in conjunction with the man and the program do not understand chinese."
Support,the consumption of cooked meat was crucial for the development of the human brain. therefore you can state that eating meat is what made humans what they are today.,"we all know well that we simply are what we eat. so basically saying that the type of food which really helped us expand, evolve and make all that progress is bad equals to saying that a priori we shouldn't have been expanding and evolving all this time."
Support,"the audience most likely does not want to let go of the past but experience the star wars it knows and appreciates, even if it includes new elements, as was the case in the force awakens.","rogue one did it. built without the presence of any jedi or sith, but at the same time, respectful to what the star wars essence is."
Support,plants are living as well and yet nobody seems to have a problem with harvesting them for consumption.,research has suggested that plants are very aware of the world around them and therefore know when they are ripped and know the difference between hot and cold touch.
Attack,"the raising and selling of livestock as meat spreads food borne and zoonotic diseases such as e. coli , toxoplasmosis , and swine flu . a vegan society reduces the potential that pathogens will transfer between animals and humans.",plant based agriculture can also spread diseases .
Attack,women could have been falsely added to an existing story instead.,"if the empty tomb story is fabricated, they were: they were added to the post mortem appearance stories from which they are otherwise absent ."
Attack,"humans cannot directly experience the extreme deep sea, which means their relative appreciation for that part of the biosphere is less than that of the animals who inhabit it.","the lack of direct experience does not represent an inherent inability to appreciate this part of the biosphere. in the future, technology might enable humans to travel the deep sea."
Attack,"to an even greater degree, the irreligious do not agree on what standard of morality to adhere to. religion, at least, allows groups of people to agree on a moral standard.",religion is not a necessary condition for having a moral standard.
Support,the existence of suffering is not incompatible with love or justice.,"suffering is an inherent part of change and growth, which a loving god would want for us."
Attack,many religious claims are about the material universe not about subjective topics.,"even if many religious claims are about astronomy, ecology or biology, they describe scientifically proven impossible situations."
Support,"if nobody follows up on claims, no hard evidence as in unambiguous solid public proof can be provided. scientists have largely ignored the subject until 2021, there are a number of allegations of suppression of in depth investigations, and politicians may have feared for repercussions on their public image or found the claims as absurd as most others who heard of them.","government , military and intelligence officials may prefer that scientists bring unambiguous evidence, rather than things being disclosed by officials. that governments other than the u.s. seem to be dragging their feet instead of leading any pro transparency efforts may support such views. releasing too much information or even their most unambiguous evidence, may possibly reduce any potential scientific efforts to gather, investigate, validate and publicize such evidence."
Support,"the russian invasion has forced the west and nato to work with azov, as they have significant manpower and experience that can be used to defeat russia.",the azov battalion first saw combat recapturing mariupol from russian forces and pro russian separatists in june 2014.
Support,it increases the belief in misinformation and falsehoods and undermines people's abilities to find accurate information.,it can respond with inaccurate conspiracy theory misinformation .
Support,"historical evidence suggests that some ancient civilizations recognized transgender people, indicating that the gender binary paradigm is subject to change.",the gender binary is a relatively new concept that was developed and perpetuated by western societies as a form of ideological control.
Support,"increasing the salary of the majority of people would have positive effects , such as improving overall happiness.","according to diminishing marginal utility , the satisfaction one receives from each dollar they earn decreases the more they earn. it thus makes sense to improve wealth equality."
Attack,"the doubting thomas story is the biblical description of how thomas encountered the risen jesus, and would thus be what skeptics of jesus would question thomas about most heavily.","the story of doubting thomas only appears in the gospel of john, which was written around the year 100 ce. by that time, thomas would have been already martyred traditionally, he was martyred 21 dec 72 ce and thus couldn't have been questioned about it."
Support,the investment in public transport is likely to fluctuate as different politicians take office and have differing priorities in public policy.,many politicians in the united states view public transportation systems as social welfare programs rather than public utilities.
Support,"even if it were legal, few people would want a polygamous marriage.",family structures are rigid to social change. thus legality will not result in many polygamous marriages.
Support,both turkey and iran seek to contain israel in the middle east.,iran and israel are engaged in a variety of proxy conflicts.
Support,"in many places, bahá'ís remain subject to severe persecution .",followers of the bahá'í faith are being deliberately forced to flee iran by negative propaganda and violent raids.
Support,"in the us, a law passed to standardise labelling for genetic modification still allows companies to only provide qr codes or telephone numbers in place of a physical product label, meaning potential information on gm ingredients is not accessible to all.","qr codes are discriminatory against the third of americans without smartphones or internet access, as well as against rural, low income, or elderly populations."
Attack,challenging companies to adapt is a cornerstone of a free market. protecting companies that rely on car traffic in large cities goes against a free market economy and the best interest of consumers.,banning cars in cities despite the preference of consumers is inherently opposed to a free market economy.
Attack,"overweight and obese people are at no greater risk of developing dying from heart disease or cancer than normal weight people, as long as they are metabolically fit.","the researchers define metabolically healthy as the absence of other metabolic conditions like insulin resistance, or diabetes. it's possible for an obese overweight person to have no other metabolic conditions, but excess adipose is itself a risk factor for such conditions, including diabetes see paragraph 21 ."
Attack,"the rich are bigger contributors to the problem of climate change. as such, they are more responsible.",the rich are behaving rationally by maximizing the utility of their resources. it is the responsibility of the government to disincentivize environmentally irresponsible behavior by increasing the costs involved.
Support,the collapse of lehman brothers in the us in 2008 had global spillover effects.,"the collapse of lehman brothers directly impacted the japanese economy and stock market , resulting in significant losses."
Attack,"historically, bad ideas take root even when hate speech is allowed, especially when presented by a gifted speaker.",oratory skill can also be used to promote positivity and hopefulness; martin luther king jr. was excellent at employing positive messaging while speaking to the public.
Attack,easy religious conversion may attract non committal converters.,converts are more likely to commited to their new faith than people raised in it merely following it out of habit.
Support,"by forcing gender equality in video games, game production becomes riskier, as there are more factors that can cause it to fail.","because game producers have limited developing time, time spent on less profitable projects takes away from more popular, and, thereby, more profitable projects. such game developers might then decide to get a different job, exasperating the issue."
Support,if a person lacks a belief in something it means that they do not accept its existence as true. if someone believes that there is no something that means they accept its existence as false.,"for example, extra terrestrial life is either true or false. a person can refuse to accept extra terrestrial life as true without maintaining that it is false."
Attack,"through the social contract , ideas have come to be viewed as intellectual property. this allows them to be owned.","intellectual property is a social contract that occurs for the individual, but not the group. emphasising the latter is a form of nonsensical tribalism, as achievements are no longer assessed on personal merit, but on accidents of nature."
Attack,many believe that corporations abuse the current copyright laws in order to restrict legitimate use of their products.,"this is not a problem intrinsic to copyright itself. it can, rather, be solved by minimizing the ability of corporations to abuse copyright laws."
Attack,"the reception of the last jedi suggests that, although the movie is controversial, many fans and critics liked it.","the polarized responses among viewers and critics are symptomatic of numerous serious underlying weaknesses in franchise continuity, plot coherence, character development, and overarching structure."
Support,"income and wealth can come from many sources and take many forms, making it difficult to acquire and accurately assess information comprehensively. a financial registry will not resolve this difficulty.",a large amount of wealth is contained in stock and other intangibles . there are serious obstacles to accurately estimating the amount of wealth held in these forms.
Attack,"society will acknowledge you for saving five lives instead of one life, making you a hero.","pulling the lever may not merit hero worship but rather draw criticism, if people think you have acted unethically."
Attack,copyright law prevents some content from being accessed in different countries .,"for online content, these laws can usually be avoided by the use of a vpn ."
Attack,"genesis 50:13 says that jacob was buried in the cave in the field of machpelah , but acts 7:15 16 says that his body was brought back to shechem.","acts 7:2 53 records direct speech from stephen, which could be in error because stephen is a fallible human being. if stephen did err, then the bible accurately recorded what he said, errors included."
Support,it is the press that has undermined the public's trust.,the press lost the public's trust without president trump's help. he called out the press for being biased and was proven correct .
Attack,in new hampshire only 53 of the state legislators have a college degree.,"a college degree says little about the competence of a politician, especially if this degree was earned in a field unrelated to political day to day activity."
Attack,"any state that subsidises healthcare or education will inevitably have to contribute to the resources needed by the child, with each additional child putting more pressure on the system.",the system is comprised of people and will collapse without more children becoming productive contributors.
Support,some feminists have taken texts that advocate violence against men literally and caused physical harm to others.,"donna hylton was invited by prominent feminists to speak at the international women's march, despite having been convicted of murder and torture."
Attack,"many planets in the milky way, given that they are not explored, may not be suitable for sustaining life.",they may nevertheless host ed machine intelligences or biologically engineered biological or semi biological organisms.
Support,this would have been amplified and reinforced by a community of jewish followers with apocalyptic and messianic expectations.,"for instance, they may have believed jesus fulfilled the prophecies in the book of daniel."
Support,placing traditional values on a pedestal while denigrating modern society is a quintessential example of the golden age fallacy .,"the traditional values of western society would include sexism , racism , and child abuse ."
Attack,mass data collection is a crucial pillar of us counterterrorism efforts and necessary to keep the population safe.,mass data collection by us intelligence agencies has led to over collection of data which has made the population less safe.
Attack,"a study done on how many animals die to produce 1,000,000 calories of a number of different food sources found that for vegetables it is only 2.55 animals, while for beef it is 29 animals and for chicken it is 251.1. this suggests significantly fewer animals are harmed in the production of vegetarian products.",animals per calorie is an absurd metric. 251.1 zooplankton are insignificant compared to 2.55 blue whales.
Attack,harris has much less political experience than many others in the us government.,"including her time as a public prosecutor, harris' public service career stretches back decades ."

Attack,male anatomy gives transgender women an unfair advantage over cisgendered women.,"muscle mass to body mass ratios effectively reduce athletic effects in transgender women due to size unless size is a factor in the sport itself, like wrestling, which is already separated by weight class in most divisions."
Support,"there is no necessary correlation between a particular cuisine, restaurant or dish's level of prestige and whether it includes meat or not.","a study suggests that it is not specific ingredients that weigh most heavily on a cuisine's reputation at all, but its combinations of different flavours at a molecular level: the study indicates that the universal popularity of cuisines such as indian comes not from its usage or non usage of certain ingredients like meat, but from its combining of certain ingredients whose flavour compounds do not significantly overlap."
Support,"certain countries may not have positive relationships, which can complicate international coordination.","pakistan and india, which border one another, have a history of conflict ."
Attack,"it is unclear the only remaining option is that the physical world is a dream of some supernatural being. if the physical realm can just exist without any explanation, then so can the supernatural.",that might have been the case were it not for the supernatural hypothesis having causes that are supernatural having effects observable in the natural world.
Support,there are many examples of the majority of individuals from a culture objecting to its appropriation.,"in the case of the washington redskins , some native americans deem the appropriation wrong."
Support,"farming meat has a disproportionate impact on the climate, contributing as many or more greenhouse gases than well known polluters like cars and other industries.",meat and dairy production directly hurts humans as it uses too much land resources and produces more greenhouse gases than driving cars.
Attack,"if zoos are aza accredited, they have taken many steps to ensure the well being of the animals within their zoo, and are sometimes better environments for the animals than the wild.","these standards are not adequate for all animals, for example, they do not meet the needs of elephants. some of the worst zoos for pachyderms are accredited by the aza."
Attack,the culture surrounding young adult literature makes it difficult to criticise in any way . critics and authors alike often face the effects of 'cancel culture' .,"critics and authors face backlash when they reduce a character to solely their understanding of a racial, sexual or cultural identity that exists within a white system."
Attack,the monarchy in belgium is one of the few institutions widely accepted by both the dutch speaking flemings in the north and the french speakers in the southern wallonia region and the french speaking enclave of brussels.,"however, the former king angered belgian flemings when equating the flemish separatist party to1930s fascism."
Attack,there have been illiterate people throughout history who have made great contributions to society.,"the existence of illiterate historical figures does not legitimize illiteracy, given that the majority of humanity's accomplishments in the modern era have been achieved by literate individuals p. 84 ."
Attack,"modern advertising can help raise awareness of new, helpful and useful products and services.",this is usually just a very small fraction of ads any given person will be seeing. ads are not the only way people can learn about products so this small fraction if any is not a good reason for it to not be usually and overall harmful.
Support,putin's hold over russia is strong enough to withstand the rebellion and its aftermath.,putin has enjoyed consistent and widespread support among the russian population.
Support,"many of the processes employed in genetic modification have occurred, in nature and in traditional agriculture, for years without any identifiable health risks. as such, it seems unlikely that gmos pose a greater risk than non gmos.","humanity has been creating and using gmos throughout history via selective breeding , a form of monoculture . as a result, many species are now significantly different from their wild ancestors in ways that are more beneficial to humans."
Attack,"if the operation to create a space elevator fails, our orbit will end up full of junk.","if the space elevator gets set up properly, then it'll be much easier to collect space debris currently there and send it to earth than increase it."
Attack,taxing water would provide revenue to preserve and improve the quality and safety of water.,it is possible that the revenue would not be spent on improvements due to governments' record of mismanaging funds.
Support,"some properties and phenomena only exist under, or are fundamentally altered by, observation .",electrons behave as waves when unobserved but behave as particles when under observation .
Attack,"not knowing how ai alignment could be done is a feature of ai alignment being an unsolved technical problem, a fact which cannot be said to be ignored by people working on ai alignment.","they are focused on the ai side, not on the side of the lack or insufficiency of goal setting by society which is what this branch is basically about. they may come up with solutions to align ai with some goals and values, with concerns about problematic values sometimes also being mentioned, which may then ultimately be used to align some ai with a military command and a few tech company ceos. that a broader approach is needed is what this branch is about."
Attack,"the existence of a real or false objectivity does not change the fact that our understanding of our perceived world can only be accessed through our imperfect perception of reality. while scientific tools can aid our objective understanding of reality, the continuous revision advancement of science suggests that we only approach objectivity, not attain it. without a perfect understanding of our 'objective' reality, real or not, we cannot have a perfect understanding of an objective morality.","again, the issue at hand is not whether we can attain objectivity, but rather, whether or not objectivity exists."
Attack,"the greatest barrier to accessing abortion is not protests outside clinics, but social stigma and policies that prevent individuals from going to clinics in the first place.","the policy doesn't have to bear the burden of solving all of the stigma against abortion. at the very least this policy will reduce that stigma, which is in and of itself an important benefit."
Support,"social psychology studies have demonstrated that imitation and mimicry are natural processes that make inter subjectivity possible, thus facilitating social behavior.","mimicking accents may indicate that people are nicer, and wish to be closer to people they are talking to this process may scale to explain why people are drawn to cultural appropriation."

Attack,believing in santa claus can teach children a valuable lesson about generosity. they will want to emulate santa.,"the legend of santa claus teaches kids that poorer kids are inherently naughtier than rich kids, as a rich santa parent would be able to give their children grander presents than a poor santa parent . this might influence a young child's core values and outlive their belief in santa."
Attack,"with the insurance of a ubi acting as a safety net, workers can challenge their employers if they find their working conditions unfair or degrading.","walking away is often too little, too late. for example, an unsafe workplace is often only exposed through serious accident. proactive government intervention is better than retroactive employee action."

Attack,the massive consumption of resources is a major driver of innovation as new solutions are required to deal with it.,"innovation to address the massive consumption of resources is finding solutions to problems that wouldn't even arise if resources were better managed. rather than contracting and then treating or curing the disease, it is better not to contract it at all."

Attack,"human lives should be measured in absolute numbers. in this regard, world war ii was the deadliest military conflict in history .","absolute numbers make it impossible to make societal comparisons. if isis brutally kills 100 of 10 prisoners, that is a very different scenario to the u.s military killing 0.001 of 1 million inadvertently during warfare."
Attack,the pope cannot be blamed for the historical shortcomings of the catholic church.,"while the pope is not responsible for the shortcomings of previous administrations, he has a moral responsibility to right wrongs done by previous administrations."

Support,none of the harms of creating a global force could compare to the benefit of the absolute intelligence sharing which would result from it.,information sharing can be crucial for stopping terrorist attacks and catching criminals. it will be much easier to pass information on to other regions when states no longer have to fear that it could be used against them in the future.
Support,"all extant examples of living organisms use the same fundamental biochemical processes , which they inherited from a common ancestor.","the genetic code translating codons the 3 letter words in dna to amino acids of which proteins are made is almost identical across all species. chemically, the translation could be arbitrary."

Attack,"history is littered with discarded morals previously believed to be objective, but that we now believe to be incorrect. this indicates morality is subjective.","science, unlike other branches of thought, discovers objective truths on which we can base morality. as more objective truths are discovered, morality will become more certain, producing an ethical framework that is not determined by historical trends."
Support,"the gospel accounts, just like other historical documents, bear no special burden of proof. there are good reasons to think the gospels are reliable until proven wrong.",the gospels are not analogous to folk tales or contemporary urban legends. tales like those of paul bunyan and pecos bill or contemporary urban legends like the vanishing hitchhiker rarely concern actual historical individuals and are thus not analogous to the gospel narratives.

Support,"removing false information or hate speech from the internet, regardless of who posted it, is not a political manipulation. it precisely aims to preserve democracy .","democracy requires informed voters to vote in their own interest . if elected officials spread misinformation about key issues, their followers will not be able to make rational decisions."
Attack,"these could have originated from the stories of the raising of lazarus or jairus's daughter, with some of the details corrupted over time.","this is mere conjecture and is implausible, as the stories of lazarus and jairus' daughters are very different in almost all key details from the story as given."
Support,"very early biblical texts teach the deity of christ, which contradicts the idea that this concept slowly developed over hundreds of years.","in philippians 2:5 8 , a text written around a.d. 62 , paul identifies jesus as an example of humility, saying that he did not consider equality with god something to be used to his own advantage. if jesus was not god, refusing to take advantage of equality with god would not be an example of humility, it would be an example of not committing blasphemy."

Support,the essential ingredient in art is the human experience.,human agency is an integral component of what constitutes art.
Attack,"various resources, while being finite, are considered to be human rights.",health care is unique because it is much more expensive than any other necessary good like food or water. it is also not readily available from nature.
Attack,"regulation of social media could increase the legal liability of users online, which would be an unfair burden.","people already shoulder legal liability in numerous other domains without issue. thus, adjusting to social media regulations will likely be a natural progression."
Support,the sexualization of women in professional environments has a damaging impact on their perceived competence and actual achievement.,pressure to conform to gendered expectations can cause people to under perform in professional environments. a genderless society would likely lead to enhanced productivity.
Attack,"the translation of the word as dug excavated is unjustified and strange, even if it was done before jesus. the incongruity of the word in the sentence context suggests it was meant to be otherwise.",it is no stranger than like a lion my hands and feet .

Support,"gender is an important tool for social organisation, which improves societal functioning .","gender delineates the roles and functions of different family members. removing gender from society would, therefore, weaken this social institution."
Support,"having private companies monitor hate speech would be even less democratic than government intervention, as people would have less ability to dictate what laws are chosen and how they are enforced.",social media websites should function more like forums and abide by national free speech laws.
Attack,"transhumanism provides existential risk reduction and improved quality of life, and is thus an adaptive behaviour.","transhumanism might have unforeseen dangers, because it has never been accomplished on a mass scale."
Attack,that christians celebrate christ's birth at the wrong time of the year does not mean the event did not happen or that the implications of his birth have been misinterpreted.,"it does indicate that religion is evolving over time and changing over time and thus is not, or at least no longer of alleged divinely inspired origin."
Attack,the us government has recently called for stricter regulations on unpiloted balloon flights.,such calls for regulation have only appeared in connection with foreign balloons; the us government has not called for stricter regulations on its own surveillance balloons.

Attack,using a universal unit of account you can ensure equal distribution of resources between regions and individuals.,equality according to the prices of distributed goods does not necessarily mean equality of chances for good lives.

Support,men and women should carry equal responsibility for protecting their country; gender parity is a key value in the modern world.,"governments impose the same tax laws on both men and women. given that conscription is a type of tax p. 4 , both men and women should be drafted in countries where conscription is practiced."
Attack,prigozhin's rebellion has provided putin and his military an opportunity to consolidate their power and form a more unified front.,"the rebellion, on the other hand, has revealed areas of weakness for putin, which gives its opponents insight into how to attack his regime."
Support,"a maximum wage may disincentivize individuals from working hard, making the economy worse off.","once someone is earning the maximum salary, there is no motivation to try to succeed further."
Attack,"being transgender is not a choice and, as such, should be respected.",a transgender identity being a choice or not does not support nor oppose the claim that a transgender woman is a woman.
Support,overlap between anti zionism and antisemitism does not mean the two concepts are equivalent; antisemites are more likely to be anti zionists because of the significance of israel to jews.,"it is also possible for one to hold antisemitic zionist views ; for example, some support the return of diaspora jews to israel in order to rid other countries of their presence."

Attack,if steroids were legal and widely used it is unlikely there would be any stigma against their use.,"although it is possible attitudes would change over time, steroid use is currently associated with lying, cheating and athletes who have been stripped of awards. that stigma would survive even if steroids became legal and permissible within the rules of sporting tournaments ."

Attack,"how pressing a cause area is depends on factors that include or are: severity of negative impact e.g. in terms of daly , severity of risk likelihood impact , timing when the issue is relevant and can be addressed , and how much can be done about it in the respective timeframe. not much more can be done about existential risks from misaligned ai risks at this point without further things being clear, it would become more pressing only once more can be done.","the negative impact of an existential catastrophe due to misaligned ai would be immense; it entails the death of every human being, in addition to whatever separate moral weight one might apply to the continuance of the species."

Attack,"technology now exists that can track enemies without the need for a tracking device on the enemy ship, even after they have jumped millions of light years away. this is an incredible plot contrivance that breaks the principles of space combat and retreat in the star wars saga, and poses a problem for future creators.",this technology is shown in the last jedi but it is created in rogue one: a star wars story. thus the use of the technology in the last jedi is honouring elements of star wars lore rather than breaking them.

Support,the us is pulling back from the north atlantic treaty organization nato which may leave it unable to provide security to europe.,the us' pivot to asia means that it has fewer military resources deployed to the atlantic and to europe.
Attack,"all caused things must have a cause. since an eternal regression of causes requires that the sum of all existence, as a whole, to be uncaused, and a finite regression of causes requires that the start of the regression be uncaused, it is necessary that an uncaused cause exists.","causation relies on the concept of time. the most accredited theory about the beginning of the universe implies that time began with the big bang. therefore, there is no cause."
Support,"just like other conceptions of what is natural, the idea of eating meat as being natural is socially constructed and subject to change.","a study looking into the reasons for individuals' 'environmentally significant consumption' found that social structural factors, macro economic structure and psychological factors can all offer an explanation of the meat or lack thereof consumption patterns of individuals."
Support,bailing out banks can help avert the threat of recession.,the added liquidity from a bailout allows banks to sustain themselves while seeking credit to maintain their operations.
Support,"the christian concept of faith is not the same as the popular notion of faith today; instead, the greek word pistis, which is often translated as faith in the bible, carries a wide range of usages and connotations, which do include belief, trust, and faith but also include faithfulness, loyalty, and allegiance.","faithfulness, loyalty, and allegiance to jesus christ are unrelated to factual beliefs about jesus christ, which themselves are largely unrelated to most purported christian propositions regarding facts that would intersect with scientific facts and theories."
Attack,monarchs are important in multi ethnic countries because the institution of monarchy unites diverse and often hostile ethnic groups under shared loyalty to the monarch instead of to an ethnic or tribal group.,"unity is achieved by sharing a belief in a system, a form of government or a nation. this is not limited to monarchy."
Attack,"if some major event happened we would expect it to be the talk of the town, let alone a miracle, which would likely be the talk of at least several towns.",jesus performed many miracles in the past. plausibly people began getting used to these stories.
Support,"a ubi would likely have a growth effect on the market by putting money in the hands of the impoverished, who studies have proven spend a greater percentage of their income than wealthier individuals.","those with lower incomes are less likely to save than their wealthier counterparts, meaning they will be adding money directly back into the economy p. 1 2 ."
Support,"in vr if people are living digitally or digitized , people will be able to provide limitless body expression.",people could create their own body with its own gender in vr.
Attack,"when making preferment life changing decisions for another entity who can't make their own, the entity making the decision's personal considerations should not be accounted for.","in that there are certain irreversible decisions that inextricably require personal beliefs to play a part the basis of a child's moral teaching being one , the personal beliefs of the parents must be allowed a role in every decision."
Attack,"in the us, state and federal governments already have the power to compel speech in various circumstances.","in existing cases, compelled testimony has a specific purpose, scope, and setting and must be justified according to general rules. they are qualitatively different to permanent compelled speech laws for all citizens."
Attack,"from a theistic god viewpoint, the world was made for humans and humans were made for the world. thus, humans are uniquely positioned to find value in the world.","most conscious beings have existed far longer than humans, so the planet certainly wasn't created specifically for people."
Support,recognizing transgender people as women requires redefining the well understood and well defined concept of womanhood .,"as it exists on a spectrum , being transgender blurs the distinction between man and woman."
Support,inequality can produce dramatic economic and social issues .,"research suggests a correlation between income, happiness and life satisfaction. income inequality thus translates into inequality of well being p. 1 ."
Support,"the biblical verses of angels having genesis 6:2, 4 , 19:1 5 , jude 6 7 and not having matthew 22:30 , mark 12:25 sex can be reconciled.","in jude 6 7 it is the sodomites, not the angels, that gave themselves up to sexual immorality and perversion."
Attack,general moral rules still apply to cases where agents have insufficient information.,it is impossible to know what is truly moral if one cannot predict the majority of the implications of one's actions.
Support,"countries would have to protect their borders even more, as people would be able to freely access countries from the orbital ring out of nowhere without repercussions one could just lower a space elevator and go into a country without anyone knowing about it .",criminals would get away with crime by escaping to other countries without anyone knowing about it.
Support,"the gender pay gap is a natural phenomenon, so governments needn't intervene.","there are differences in interests, beginning at birth, which correspond to the differences in career choice between men and women p. 4 ."
Support,if priests were married they would be better equipped to counsel members of the church on issues involving family and marriage.,"sociologist and former monk, richard sipe, argues that celibacy promotes psychosexual immaturity . this likely impairs a priest's judgement and counsel with respect to intimate relationships."
Support,discrimination is a serious cause and is so imbedded in business practice that it needs regulation to assist in changing things.,"in the us, there is a growing recognition that market forces will not correct the lack of gender diversity in leadership roles. if the government doesn t intervene then there is no guarantee that this problem will ever be resolved."
Support,social media can be used to maintain relationships that would otherwise be neglected and lost.,many people have used social media in order to maintain long distance relationships.
Attack,chief has been able to win in almost every battle he was in.,he was unable to prevent the banished from slaughtering most of humanity.
Attack,these elements are all irrelevant to the idea that is most important to the historicity of a resurrection: that the body was put somewhere but then mysteriously disappeared.,"what christians relied on most for establishing the resurrection were the post mortem appearances, not the disappearance of the body, as the body could have disappeared in other ways e.g. if someone moved it ."
Support,we cannot ever know the full ramifications of our actions.,we can never understand any situation to the degree required to truly say that this evil action will be outweighed by it's good results.
Support,"when the state owns this artwork, all groups in the country have access to this artwork.","this means that more groups can appreciate this artwork, and by extension, this culture."
Support,the welfare state is necessary to sustain the system.,capitalism incentivizes predatory economic practices. welfare is a check on unbridled markets.
Attack,"agi that are sufficiently advanced or complex would be impossible to control or regulate, meaning that there is little reason to think the denial of rights is anything more than a temporary measure.","there are currently humans with intelligence that surpasses the understanding of an average human, yet they pose no risk and could easily be controlled if they did."
Support,"conversely, arming ukraine with nuclear weapons reduces the possibility of reaching a negotiated peace settlement with russia.",russia has repeatedly emphasized that the demilitarization of ukraine is a critical strategic goal in their ongoing conflict.
Support,"doing so may be harmful for us or not doing so until now more beneficial for us. for example, we may thereby build new technologies with which we destroy human civilization, or decrease well being due to fear and other psychological impacts, or disturb political stability in nonbeneficial ways, or create new religions that ultimately causes more harm, and so on.","even if they do wouldn't cause such harms and analyses do not indicate that such would occur or outweigh the needs for public transparency, some individuals or groups may have views that they would. astronomer avi loeb for example noted that a sizable fraction of humanity may view alien intelligence s like 'god' . moreover, accepting and disclosing the presence may go against many people's religious perspectives that place humanity at the center and superhuman beings to be gods or supernatural."
Attack,limiting immigration is a direct way to solve issues of overpopulation and sustainability.,"while limiting immigration is definitely a direct way to tackle said problems, it is far from the only way. a sustainable population does not necessarily mean a small population. australia should expand its population to boost the economy while also looking into efforts to improve wealth and resources distribution."
Attack,the most prosperous countries are democracies. there's not a single despot in the modern world which can compete with the best democracies.,perhaps none of the current despots are enlightened.
Attack,"the dramatic supposedly 'divine intervention' was not the one that was expected but could be made to fit with jesus' teachings i.e. matthew 16:21 from that time on jesus began to show his disciples that he must go to jerusalem and suffer many things at the hands of the elders, chief priests, and scribes, and that he must be killed and on the third day be raised to life.","this teaching didn't take, because the next verse reads , peter took him aside and began to rebuke him. 'never, lord!' he said. 'this shall never happen to you!'"
Attack,"if the soul was the mind and the seat of consciousness then the only thing the brain would need to do would be receive information from the soul, decode it, and send it to the rest of the body. the same is true in the reverse direction it would need to receive the senses encode them and send them to the soul. in reality though the brain is a processing unit filled with neural networks that process information themselves without the need to outsource the computing to a soul.","the brain may be all the body needs to process physical stimuli; however, the soul is not claimed to conduct these functions for a person but to rather process non physical stimuli."
Support,a strong anti western sentiment exists in places like russia and the middle east. attempts by western countries to act positively can be seen as hostile and concealing an insidious motive.,western policies in the middle east and south asia conflict with the resurgence of nationalism in these areas. western interference is often viewed as a threat to local autonomy and control.
Support,some people will still go through unofficial channels to get their drugs.,those who are already indebted to drug cartels will be forced to continue to buy from them.
Attack,thirty five percent of women worldwide have experienced either physical and or sexual intimate partner violence or sexual violence by a non partner at some point in their lives. feminism can help combat this by changing social norms.,"feminist activism, in particular the metoo movement, has been criticized for creating an anti men bias in legal systems. critics say this may harm due process, and encourage people to assume the guilt of the accused."
Support,there are many meat eaters which have certain food preferences and will not ever eat certain dishes. however nobody would say they are unsociable because of that.,"some people dislike the hot spices used in asian cuisine and thus avoid food from e.g. korea, thailand, china etc."
Support,"age restrictions on activities such as driving, consuming alcohol, and getting tattoos are in place because children are considered insufficiently capable of making well considered decisions.","age restrictions on activities reflect society's commitment to protecting young individuals' well being by ensuring they have reached a certain level of physical, emotional, and cognitive maturity before engaging in those activities."
Attack,"jesus gives no new teachings after dying, despite spending 40 days with the disciples. before dying, jesus gave very many teachings, thus, the total absence of postmortem teachings that can be reliably sourced to the historical jesus is extremely suspicious.","after jesus's resurrection, john 21:25 says, jesus did many other things as well. if every one of them were written down, i suppose that even the whole world would not have room for the books that would be written."
Support,the chance of human extinction is much lower than the chance of endangered species' extinction.,"there are around eight billion humans alive on earth and over 16,300 endangered animal species."
Support,polling numbers show that pope francis is very popular amongst religious people.,"when asked in a survey, 88 of american catholics responded that they think pope francis is doing a good job."
Support,learning this information will help in better preparing students in dealing with situations that they would have otherwise have a hard time dealing with when they become parents themselves.,"since almost everyone attends secondary or high school, it is a good setting to teach students about child development."
Support,"to this day, cities and towns with large mexican american populations usually hold parades, put on shows with mariachi music and folk dances, and enjoy traditional food.",most large american cities will host cinco de mayo themed festivals in which the local latino community takes part.
Attack,zoos are educational and provide knowledge about wildlife.,"this education could be provided without the animals there. with the technology we now have, we could probably have robot versions of each animal on display instead."
Attack,"the bureaucratic nature of government processes means that government measures cannot match the pace of scientific advancements. therefore, a pause would allow governments to catch up.",it is unlikely that six months would be enough time for governments to implement the kinds of comprehensive global regulations necessary to ensure future ai development is safe.
Attack,"the bible cannot be cited as evidence, as it is being questioned along with any questioning of the christian myths. this is cyclical reasoning.",the bible can be cited as evidence so long as the evidence isn't the bible says it so i believe it.
Support,the gardener of the tomb could have removed the body.,the gardener could have removed the body to prevent curious disciples from coming to trampl e over his newly planted lettuce seeds .
Support,there are cases when communist governments may not provide for their people.,"communism is merely a political name for the ideology, yet some communist countries act similarly with other political views."
Support,"as carbon prices spread, concerns about competitiveness should subside , and losses in emissions intensive production may be counterbalanced by gains in growing low carbon sectors.",the eu's soft power has set it apart in today's political landscape as a global leader and role model. it thus has a moral duty to set a positive example.
Attack,"since the introduction of the intersectionality framework in the 1990s, feminism has become increasingly intersectional , giving a voice to the oppressed, including minorities and immigrants of all genders .","intersectional feminism promotes the welfare of non white, non heterosexual people over white, heterosexual men and women."
Attack,there were claims 'patient zero ' as well as two other early covid 19 cases have worked on gain of function research on coronaviruses at the wuhan institute of virology.,"a newly released u.s. report of declassified information on covid 19 s origin , from the office of the director of national intelligence odni , fails to name ben hu as patient zero or substantiate that any wiv scientists had the initial cases of covid 19 . an odni report concludes that the available information about cases of mild illness es of wiv researchers in the fall of 2019 neither supports nor refutes either hypothesis ."
Support,"there are no testimonies of any of jesus' disciples. we know almost precisely nothing about what they thought, what they did, and what they came to believe.",the apostle john's history is obscure and mostly based on legends.
Attack,"we can eat meat responsibly choose carefully, develop small productions and local food, and make it a rare and savoured special dish.","small productions cannot compete with large ones because they are small. it's already the case that most farms are small but most animals come from big farms, so adding more small farms won't help. for example, in the us in 2012: 57 of farms with cattle sold less than 20 cattle each, while 4.6 of all cattle came from such farms. 0.9 of farms sold at least 1000 cattle each, while 51 of all cattle came from such farms. source and more details and examples."
Attack,"the only reason animals have not human given rights is because we have chosen not to give rights to them. by their own existence, they have the right to life.","rights only exist in the minds of humans, so does the 'right to life'. therefore, the claim contradicts itself."
Support,a homeschooling ban could be enforced in the same ways that other child exploitation laws are enforced.,parents would likely be deterred from homeschooling if they worry someone could tell the authorities about their illegal actions.
Support,there have been numerous failed legal challenges to the results of the us election.,the lawyers representing trump have been oddly reluctant to present evidence of their claims of fraud.
Support,"frequently repeating lies is an unwise political strategy, suggesting that trump is not a particularly smart president.","without being firmly tethered to the truth, trump created a misinformation ecosystem that could grow out of his control, leading to violence and, ultimately, the capitol hill riots."
Support,traditional universities are adopting online programs because of how successful they are.,"in the us, there was a 5 growth in college students taking online courses from 2015 to 2016."
Support,"king charles engaged in an extramarital affair with camilla parker, thereby betraying princess diana, and causing pain to the british public.","considering princess diana's immense and enduring popularity among the british public, this breach of her trust has not been well received by the citizens."
Attack,the presence of women in management settings can expose previously overlooked barriers to entry and allow those to be tackled.,"researchers found that the marriage structure shaped men's attitudes, beliefs and behaviors toward women in the workplace. imposing gender quotas will not address these root causes of workplace sexism rendering them counter productive."
Attack,eating and producing meat heavily contributes to climate change.,"this does not make eating meat inherently wrong, because the massive scale of our population is the main cause of the massive scale of farming and therefore also the massive scale of green house gas emissions."
Attack,it may be possible to make israeli violations of international law in their dealing with palestine less frequent if the us recognises the latter state.,"america has already taken a stance against settlements in the west bank and, therefore, does not need to recognise palestine as a state."
Attack,the state should not intervene on behalf of a worker who voluntarily accepted a job and the associated wage.,"the state intervenes in pay disputes, particularly in situations where an employee is being underpaid by a firm or paid below the minimum wage."
Attack,an educated population is essential to a nation's economic prosperity.,many factors contribute to a nation's economic prosperity. having a well educated population does not guarantee economic success.
Support,"a universal language would threaten linguistics and cultural diversity, eradicating the benefits of the latter.",differences between languages are often due to differing cultures . a specific language reflects a specific culture; to sideline different native languages in favour of a universal one would be to sideline cultural diversity.
Attack,many christians refers here to imperfect human beings and thus they are more likely to be wrong than divine beings.,"the bible was written by human beings too; their propensity to be wrong presumably made its way into parts of the bible as well, thus justifying why some parts should be ignored."
Attack,climate change and its effects may be more politically divisive than the attempts to fight it are.,fighting climate change could itself increase pressure on political governance if some countries feel that others are freeloading .
Support,robust and evidence based integration programmes in the host country could help mitigate these issues.,"canada provides a comprehensive resource package for refugees to help them build links with native canadians in their communities, access language learning resources, and integrate themselves into society."
Support,president trump did not respect the legitimacy of the 2020 elections .,president trump encouraged his supporters to fight after the 2020 election's results.
Support,most governments face budget deficits that taxing water can fix.,"taxing water can provide large tax revenues for the government, which would balance the budget deficits."
Support,"in a constitutionally limited republic, people do not adopt programs simply because a majority believe they are necessary.",a majority people or lawmakers believed the defense of marriage act or similar was necessary but it was deemed unconstitutional and overruled nonetheless.
Attack,this is an anthropomorphic analogy. it is a trait of human psychology and one in this case which is incorrect. comparing a human child to a feed lot animal is unbalanced in value. a feed lot animal if left in it's natural condition consumes plants and in turn is consumed by other animals. if humans were not eating them they would be eaten by other predators scavengers in the wild. their condition in life does not change much between feed lot and field.,"animals in the wild have freedom of movement and other increased choices not available to farm animals. quality of life is not decided purely by length or absence of suffering, or how its end is met."
Support,"even if regulations could protect people from harmful ideas in the public sphere, people will inevitably still be exposed to the same harmful ideas in their private lives.",regulations on speech have barely any impact on what people do or say in the privacy of their homes.
Support,vegetarian diets are not always adequate for more vulnerable populations like children and pregnant women.,"pregnant and breastfeeding women, if vegetarian, need to supplement heavily to get adequate nutrients."
Attack,"under a two tier healthcare system , the government will provide basic care while individuals can still choose to privately pay for better care.",individuals who use public care may believe they are inferior to those using private care.
Attack,"one researcher argues that smoking does not contradict free will, because the motivation caused by smoking does not make it impossible to stop smoking p. 67 . the act of quitting smoking is an example of free will.","the conditioning required to quit smoking indicates the absence of free will, because if we could freely choose to not be addicted to something, no conditioning would be needed."
Support,studies have shown that homeschooled students are at a reduced risk of developing mental health issues like anxiety and depression.,a study found that traditionally schooled children experienced higher levels of depression and some types of emotional and behavioural problems than homeschooled children.
Support,there are several mechanisms one could use to select an enlightened despot.,hereditary rule if we re looking at super smooth transition whereby an heir is raised from birth to be fit for the position has been implemented with effectiveness throughout history.
Attack,school curricula can be expanded to include these aspects of the real world in addition to the current skills and subjects taught.,"given that there are only a fixed number of schooling hours, it would be difficult to expand curricula to include more life skills without either sacrificing entire current subjects or the current depth of each subject."
Attack,"people would learn and use techniques to manipulate and affect behaviors, not how to avoid falling under manipulative influence.","most people, when learning about cognitive biases and how they influence our reasoning, would think of how it influences our own reasoning and how to avoid the pitfalls that come with that."
Attack,bullet voting is rare in real world score voting elections.,"in the 2015 republican liberty caucus straw poll , 44 of voters bullet voted on their score ballots."
Support,"plant based sources of zinc , such as legumes and whole grains, contain phytates that can inhibit zinc absorption.","phytates are one of the types of the so called anti nutrients that can be found in plat based diets which interfere with the absorption of nutrients and also cause nausea, bloating, headaches, rashes and nutritional deficiencies."
Support,"a person sentenced to death has no way to rehabilitate themselves, unlike if they were merely imprisoned.","in prison, criminals can receive support to resolve psychological issues. such rehabilitation could help them make amends to their victims and others."
Attack,"removing gender from society would not prevent any individual from engaging in any specific behavior; instead, it would remove the gendered barriers that prevent individuals from engaging in non conforming ones.",speaking the words i am a man or i am a woman is a specific behaviour which removing gender from society would require the suppression of.
Support,"male animals are often visibly aroused by females even during non sexual encounters. public nudity, then, would not desexualize the human body.",pornography addicts exposed to soft core nudity can alter their dopamine sensitivity to the extent that one can only become aroused by more exotic or extreme forms of arousal.
Support,the doctrine of double effect states that a bad side effect opioid use shortening patients' lifespan is morally permissible if it is counterweighted by the good main effect the patient not dying .,this is most obviously demostrated in the treament of cancer through harsh chemotherapy.
Support,this is specifically important for people with stressful jobs who end up having to battle with addiction or post traumatic stress.,there are numerous benefits associated with support from colleagues in the workplace.
Support,the rebellion has enabled russia to dismantle the influence that private militias exert within the country and on the larger war effort.,"the defense ministry has now mandated all private companies, including militias like the wagner group, to enter into contracts with it ."
Support,"it is possible for people to research sex acts and their likelihood of leading to pregnancy. as such, they are aware of the risks, and it is possible for them to consent to pregnancy.","it is possible for people to participate in sexual activities, such as oral sex, which will not result in pregnancy."
Support,there is scientific evidence that buddhist meditation practices can have beneficial therapeutic impacts.,it is a practice that causes much larger tangible psychological impacts than prayer for instance.
Attack,crowdsourcing laws would bring more citizens into the process of lawmaking as active participants.,the possible negative result of not participating in these crowdfunding discussions is so great that it effectively forces people to devote time to this system just to maintain the status quo. this is not a responsibility that citizens who pay taxes should not have to carry.
Support,"although humans have led a variety of species to extinction, this is not irreversible, given the existing and developing technology for de extinction .",scientists have already brought back the pyrenean ibex from extinction.
Attack,"the entire canto bight story would have worked better had poe gone with finn and rose, and it would have allowed us to see finn and poe's chemistry on screen and avoided the pointless mutiny attempt.","rian johnson chose to pair rose with finn for the canto bight sequence because it didn't work well with poe being paired with finn instead. in his opinion, the two would haven gotten along too well, which would have made for an uninteresting plot."
Attack,gender neutral bathrooms are increasingly introduced in public places and may become normalised in a similar manner to gender segregated bathrooms.,this argument employs the fallacy of composition ; the reasons for which gender neutral bathrooms work in some locations may not apply universally.
Support,"none of the accounts in the gospels contain primary source material about experiences of the risen christ. only the pauline epistles contain such accounts e.g. galatians 1 :11 2:21, 1 corinthians 15 , 2 corinthians 12 :1 10 , and these are very different than the resurrection appearances in the later written gospels. this strongly suggests that the later written accounts are fabrications.",there are no records in the nt of any significant teachings of jesus after he dies. the absence of any such teachings is very surprising and suspicious if he actually did rise bodily from the dead and spent weeks with his disciples as their resurrected lord.
Attack,"neuroscientific evidence and methods are comparitively and particularly crude, due to their novel nature and lack of replicability . as such, whatever determines our physical brain states remains unknown.","all scientific fields are in a relatively crude state compared to future advancements. since neuroscience is predicted to become more precise as the technology and methodology become more advanced, it is reasonable to make predictions and interpretations around the current scientific consensus."
Attack,the elimination of humans would also completely eliminate human happiness.,"human happiness and comfort for some often comes at the expense of others through the exploitation of labor, exploration, and the farming of weaker species, along with the unfair distribution of resources and opportunities p. 7 ."
Attack,just because many countries currently act selfishly is not a justification for them doing so. they have an obligation to pursue just policies and outcomes.,the primary obligation of a country is to look after the best interest of its citizens even if that is at the expense of the citizens of other countries.
Attack,"online hate speech is largely trolling , meaning most comments are made in jest and those who post such comments are mostly kidding.","regardless of the original intent, trolling can still intimidate and hurt its recipients."
Support,jesus lacks attributes that the old testament describes that the messiah would have,"ezekiel implies the messiah would be a human man, rather than a divine being."
Support,"any pope speaking on the issues pope francis has is a massive step for the catholic church, and should not be belittled.",the catholic church is not the same as other public institutions that can implement reform immediately. it must progress according to the wishes of members of the church.
Support,"when considering aid towards another, if someone has cast their banner high claiming the duty as theirs there are usually other areas to help away from them, they likely haven't cast their banner over the whole park or every park in town. however, the duty of government has asserted itself everywhere and deeply penetrated nearly all minds.","if a private person or group is doing something for the poor or the commons, they are likely more approachable than the government. governments are often known even if relatively falsely as bureaucratic unmoving nightmares to deal with."
Attack,inequality will persist and worsen without the application of chatgpt.,"the political and economic capital currently being invested in chatgpt like tools could be used for alternative solutions for inequality, such as progressive taxation and social safety nets."
Support,there is no evidence to support the assertions made by religion.,"belief should be based on verifiable evidence. since there is no substantial evidence to support the assertions of any particular religion, it is better to not follow one p. 17 ."
Attack,the british monarch holds no executive authority over government affairs.,"king charles has promised to significantly alter the role of the monarchy in national governance. therefore, king charles will have a profound impact on the future of the country."
Attack,valuing one's species above others is how species survive.,"evolution is a process of random genetic mutation and selection. therefore, it has no bearing on the relative value of different living things."
Attack,"women are deemed as less attractive if they have had more sexual partners , while men are commended for the same behavior.",promiscuity is disliked by both genders in relationship situations.
Attack,"the north was highly industrialized and could operate without the use of slave labor, while the south was primarily agrarian and required large numbers of workers to work the fields.","due to increasing mechanization in agriculture, it is likely that the south would have reduced the amount of labor needed to maintain antebellum output levels after the war."
Support,"while fitness games are designed to simulate physical exercise, it is simpler and cheaper to exercise without video games.",it is possible to access free instructional workout videos online without having to buy a video game console or a gaming computer.
Support,"society wide shaming is one path to getting these policies, but there are also other less destructive ones.","obesity related ngos, such as the world obesity federation , already places pressure for policy change."
Attack,"not all thought and expression are beneficial to society. absolute freedom of speech would permit racism, hence some level of political correctness is beneficial to society.","on the contrary, political correctness stimulates racism. if people are reluctant and afraid to express their thoughts, which may be ignorant, wrong, etc. nobody can correct or ridicule them an echo chamber . the ability to do so is important in order to prevent bad ideas becoming bad actions."
Support,"a different way of population control would be to regulate the birth rate, as china did with its two child policy.","china also has now abandoned the two child policy , increasing to a three child policy, while keeping the death penalty."
Attack,"the claim begs the question whether public vaccine policy is in the interest of the general good as it is a matter of opinion and highly debatable, to say the least.","except of course that it's not exactly highly debatable , when it comes to the scientific community, which is pretty clear on both whether vaccines are safe and whether they should be mandatory due to the fact that they've been preventing life threatening diseases for ages."
Support,vertical farming may be able to fill shortfalls in agricultural production as it is very spatially efficient .,"at their most efficient, vertical stack farms can produce 350 times more food per square yard than soil based farming."
Attack,"humans provide the best chance for life to spread beyond the confines of earth. therefore, humans are good for life in general.",that is a goal for humans. an animal doesn't care if it lives on earth or mars.

Support,the right to procreate is an essential liberty that falls under reproductive rights and is internationally recognized. denying someone the right to procreate through the implementation of a parenting license runs contrary to this.,international human rights law recognizes reproductive rights which underlie the right to procreate.
Attack,"jesus was assumed into heaven after coming back from the dead. if jesus had remained dead, that would far better fit with the alleged prophecy.","if that was the case, jesus would have failed to fulfill isaiah 53:11 ."

Support,disposing of the solid waste from large populations causes environmental pressure in cities.,domestic solid waste generated by households accounts for one third to one half of all solid waste generated in large cities. this amount depends on the numbers of people and the amount of rubbish they each generate.
Support,"consent is not essential to all forms of responsibility. if we do not consent to be citizens and yet gain responsibilities to our states, then parents do not need to consent to birth to have responsibility for their children.","it is generally understood that children have responsibilities to their parents even though children do not, and until they are much older, cannot consent to anything."
Attack,animals cannot possibly enjoy the same quality of life that they'd have had in the wild if they were bred and raised with the sole purpose of being eaten.,"if domesticated animals are raised ethically in a way as to have reasonable lives, then they are allowed to exist and experience life, where in a world without meat farming they probably would not."
Support,"compared to other addictions, like cigarettes or alcohol, watching television is not as harmful.","abusing alcohol damages many internal organs, as well as increasing risk factors for heart attacks and stroke ."

Support,"some studies suggest that the link between income inequality and personal happiness is more complex than this, proposing an inverted u shaped trend rather than a straightforward negative relationship. thus, greater income inequality may not always necessarily correlate with reduced happiness.","these researchers propose that when income inequality is moderately high, many individuals tend to be unhappily jealous of wealthier peers; however, when income inequality is higher still, many poorer citizens view this inequality as a signal of social mobility and thus anticipate their own upward mobility, which increases their happiness."
Support,everyone who has ever had a credit card or a bank account has already made a lot of their personal information available to a portion of the public.,"people can make approximations on someone's income based on their spending patterns e.g. where they live, where they shop etc. ."
Support,some lgbtq youth commit suicide due to verbal bullying. learning self defense will not help with this.,"verbal bullying is more prevalent than physical bullying, therefore resources should focus efforts on diminishing this."
Support,"idealism cannot explain why one's experience of reality is affected by what, on idealism, would merely be appearances.","for example, idealism cannot explain why it becomes more difficult to think carefully when hungry or drunk or tired, or why certain molecules and not others, when ingested, produce radically different states of mind."

Attack,banning circumcision would be an act of discrimination against the religions and cultures which practice it.,"a ban which was made for objective reasons having nothing to do with religion and culture, and which applies universally, i.e. not based on the religion of the subjects, cannot be considered discrimination in the sense of bigotry."

Support,post hoc ergo propter hoc. atrocities are a constant and recurring theme in human history. no single economic or political system can be considered a necessary precursor for their occurance.,"mercantilist colonialist economics killed millions worldwide. if one counts famines due to misallocation as an atrocity as is typically done to inflate death tolls in the cases of china and the ussr , the british empire starved somewhere between 16 35 million people to death in south asia, including 2 5 million bengali people deliberately left to starve in just one year as resources were diverted to provision british troops during world war ii."
Attack,"cows have been seen to have incredibly strong bonds, particularly between mothers and their calves. on these farms the calves are often taken away from the mother to be killed and there are numerous reports of mother cows calling and searching for their babies.","this sentience is momentary and ephemeral , thus should not interfere in animals' ability to predict death and retain recent events. parenthood problems could, therefore, be avoided by sedating and giving more humane treatment to animals."

Attack,"this is hume's is ought distinction . to justify how things ought to be, you need something other than what currently is .",people misunderstand hume's is ought distinction. hume never said that it was impossible to derive an ought from an is. he merely remarked on the non sequitur that some people would make when they went straight from an is to an ought without justification. he did not say that such justification could not be given.

Attack,"theists believe in god while atheists do not. just as the burden of proof falls on those who assert the existence of a particular god, it also falls on those who assert that there is no god whatsoever. the true claim that the five senses cannot indicate the existence of god is a justification for agnosticism, not atheism.",the prefix a means without. atheism is therefore without belief in a god and agnostic is without knowledge .
Attack,"romanticizing the losers of that war only serves to engender continued opposition to the current establishment, and creates conflict where there should be none.","nevertheless, opposition to the establishment is one of the concepts that led to the very creation of the us. critical opinions about current systems are definitely not something that should be censored and neither should critical opinions of the past be hidden away from the public."

Attack,moral intuitions i.e. opinions on what constitutes morality are all we have for understanding morality. they always supercede the natural or current state.,"the claim that moral intuitions are all we have presupposes that nature cannot be used to judge morals. rather, a claim could be made that nature is all we have to judge morals by, as nature was created by god, and god is inherently moral."
Support,"cooperative multiplayer games, such as massive multiplayer online games mmo , often require players to join groups to overcome difficult challenges or compete with other players.","massive multiplayer online role playing games mmorpg like world of warcraft wow make the interactions with other players and the organization in social networks an essential, unscripted part of the game."

Attack,"luke skywalker was forced into a plot device in order to make ben solo evil. the reason why he became evil was shoehorned. luke would've never assaulted anybody at night, let alone his own nephew just because he felt darkness in them. it's a person that believed there's still good left in vader, the sith lord, that was a murderer and comitted a genocide on billions.","luke did not enter the hut with the intention to do ben harm. he wanted to probe ben's thoughts to see how far the darkness had gone. it was in that instant that luke considered it and then rejected that possibility, creating the regret and shame he shows in the last jedi."
Support,"clean eating dietary trend may encourage psychological problems around food, and in some cases, lead to eating disorders such as anorexia nervosa an or orthorexia nervosa on .","research shows that the healthy eating community on instagram has a high prevalence of orthorexia symptoms, with higher instagram use being linked to increased symptoms. the prevalence of orthorexia nervosa among the study population was 49 , which is significantly higher than the general population 1 ."
Attack,millennial and gen z adults think its morally wrong to bring children into the world due to the fact that their children will contribute to climate change.,"it is not morally bad to have kids; rather, climate change itself is morally bad as it affects people's abilities to have families and share their lives with children."

Support,animals cannot have rights because they cannot exercise or defend their rights.,"if an animal can be confined by humans, then it does not have an innate right to be free."
Support,women only spaces that serve a functional purpose should be available to all who can make use of the intended purpose of the space.,"women only spaces that promote networking and career advancement should be open to trans women, as they face an even wider wage gap than cis women and may see their earnings fall by up to a third after transitioning."

Attack,"ted rice claims he saw mantid aliens eating infants children and that he has not heard about any evidence of them being benign. this may be consistent with e.g. huggins who claimed to have seen a room full of his babies during an abduction albeit with gray alien heads and parkes who in some regression stated he saw mantid aliens were killing children as their culture. phil schneider also claimed this. if anything of that was true, that may motivate agencies and aliens to keep things secret.",ted rice apparently claims to only remember things via hypnosis. it likely have just been vivid dreams fueled by horror movies like final days of planet earth and other abduction reports.

Support,"the designation of terrorist organization is an arbitrary distinction that does not necessarily reflect the manner of violence, the scale of violence, or the threat to the united states. the designation is based only on political concerns.","the us government has yet to declare the kkk a terrorist organization. their rules for acknowledging terrorist groups seem to be arbitrary at best, and knowingly deceitful at worst."

Attack,public shaming very rarely leads to severe consequences for large corporations.,greenpeace has successfully utilized public pressure to compel major corporations to amend their harmful practices.
Support,we do not need to leave earth just for scientific development. there is a lot to gain scientifically just by staying and observing mars from earth like missions .,"this is evidenced by all the scientific gains already made by mars missions, like the mars curiosity rover ."
Attack,"requiring transgender people to use spaces that match the sex they were assigned at birth would require transgender men to use women only spaces, placing themselves and others at risk of distress.","due to safety concerns, many trans men already avoid men only spaces, particularly changing rooms, as they risk verbal and physical attacks ."
Attack,"the portrayal of gender equality in video games can conceal actual gender inequality which persists in society. this is because the portrayal of gender equality in video games may lead people to believe that gender equality has been achieved in real life, when that isn't the case.","this might make it all the more jarring when inequality is witnessed in real life, therefore creating greater momentum to rectify such social ills."
Attack,despotism is inherently wrong because it doesn't legitimately represent the individual.,"inherently is just a semantic stop sign . there is nothing in the laws of physics that say that despotism is wrong. we decide this, just as we decided what human rights should be ."
Attack,it would be the starting point of becoming an interplanetarian species.,"interplanetary colonization can be done even without immortality because people can travel to other planets in the solar system, colonize them, and perhaps terraform them as mortals."
Attack,"the passage says stabbed in his side , not in his heart. if he were stabbed in or near the heart, the passage would likely say so.","if the spear was stabbed deep enough, it could easily have reached his heart from his side."
Attack,student unions ensure greater accountability of professors and administration.,"good professors could be fired for being too strict. the consequence would be a less demanding education, because professors would be afraid to fail students in exchange for being fired."
Support,"children whose parents are deemed unfit will end up in the foster care system, which is problematic in most countries.",the foster care system in most countries is subject to exploitation and inefficiencies.
Attack,"countries like saudi arabia, egypt, qatar, kuwait or the uae find it difficult to side with the us publicly on iran unless washington pressures israel on a peace initiative . if anything, recognition increases regional cooperation with the us.","saudi arabia, qatar and the uae have a strong anti iran position due to sectarian tensions . the us does not need to pressure them for support."
Attack,"transhumanism would be the end of biological evolution, as it would rely on design as opposed to natural selection of mutated traits.","from the beginning of humanity, humans always find ways to evade evolution and escape natural selection's effects: by inventing medics, prostheses, vaccines, etc. transhumanism is just another method, nothing different than what we've already achieved in isolating ourselves from evolution to begin with."
Support,scientists have developed and are developing various skills and expertise and this is a place where one's skills will be valued and contribute to society.,they are more likely to be able to spot and correct misinformation and suboptimal content due to industry related conflicts of interest by other editors.
Attack,"the creation of peace usually has more to do with increasing technology , not women's rights.","peace is bred through the general expectations that exist within a society. where more people have adverse feelings towards violence, it will decrease."
Attack,"god by his nature would not lie. lying is a human trait, not a divine trait.",there is an inherent conflict of interest in believing the claims of a being which asserts that it cannot lie.
Support,"global trends in consumerism promote selfishness and the valuing of material and monetary wealth over value of nature. without humans, these mindsets and practices would not exist.","innovation would not likely be able to keep pace with or surpass the level of destruction currently being sustained by the planet; therefore, the removal of humans would be ideal in order to mitigate the damage."
Attack,people would spend more time on earth and thus experience more moments of happiness than they otherwise would.,if people have an infinite amount of opportunities to be happy the happiness will mean nothing as there is no special value to something that is common and infinite.
Attack,there is no such place and you cannot steal people just because they were born in your land.,there are some islands or spots in deserts etc. where it's most likely you will never be approached by any governemental organisation.
Attack,psychiatrist and blogger scott alexander believes there is a 33 chance that ai will end humanity in the future.,we should not base our predictions on the future of ai technology on those who are not experts in the industry.

Support,women are most often be arrested as street dealers or traffickers.,"lower income, uneducated women are often viewed as 'expendable drug mules '."
Attack,not all people who were infected with the covid 19 virus were identified. this made it challenging to calculate the actual fatality rate .,"inadequate testing suggests that the actual fatality rate was higher than reported, not lower. this further entailed that it was deadlier than the flu."
Attack,"expanding military conscription to women will legitimize it, which is counter to the principles and policies of modern society. the harm of this action is more important than any gain in gender equality.",conscription is a legitimate means of improving the defensive capabilities of a nation with security concerns.
Attack,choosing not to release an ai to the public before safety measures are implemented is not an option for the open source community; the public can't keep things out of its own hands.,"it certainly is an option for open source communities those developers simply usually have fewer resources to be able to do so, albeit likely would welcome help by organizations or people who care about safety, which is also the case for vulnerabilities in open source software , albeit foss is considered to still be more secure."
Support,"legalising euthanasia through other means may lead to vulnerable people, who aren't suffering greatly but are becoming expensive for their families to support, being coerced into doing it.",around 1 in 5 patients who choose euthanasia in the netherlands acts under pressure from family members.
Attack,"the ontological argument demonstrates that if a maximally great being is even possible, then a maximally great being must exist. this is very different from establishing epistemological warrant.","this rests on an if condition if a maximally great being is possible . until that if condition can be verified as true, the ontological argument does not support the original thesis of god exists ."
Support,senior military figures supported prigozhin's capture of rostov on don.,the apparent agreement with the actions of prigozhin's rebellion among senior military officials shows deep problems in russia's military that could persist after the rebellion.
Attack,"some experts find that many of the more catastrophic agi scenarios depend on premises they find implausible. for instance, there seems to be a prevailing but unspoken assumption that sufficient intelligence amounts to limitless real world power .","saying that there is a prevailing but unspoken assumption is putting an argument in people's mouths that they didn't make, i.e. a strawman."
Support,governments have the capacity to overcome the practical difficulties of such a policy.,governments would have the breadth of knowledge required to assess individuals.
Support,"regardless of this, it is still possible that working in slaughterhouses could exacerbate pre existing violent tendencies.","one would have to avoid empathizing with the animals they must slaughter in order to avoid emotional pain when working in a slaughterhouse, which would likely involve avoiding or minimizing empathy entirely which would in turn reduce one's empathy with other human beings and make one more likely to commit crimes or inflict violence against them."
Attack,it is not necessary for the state to own the artwork for this cultural enrichment to occur. the public could just look at photos of the work online or prints of it.,looking at the work in person allows one to view all the minute details that are lost when it is put online or in print version.
Attack,"the descendants of noah shem, ham, and japheth are described as spreading out to become all the nations of the middle east including the greeks, egyptians, ethiopians, parthians, persians, babylonians, etc. no local flood could have covered such an extent.",the list of nations founded by noah's descendants does not necessarily cover all nations
Attack,"these interventions have often been heavily criticized , especially by political leaders, who claim the pope is overstepping and misusing his influence.","given the international reach of the church, the pope has a responsibility to comment on issues that affect people from multiple countries."
Support,even under an 'ideal' farming circumstances i.e. free range; painless death killing an animal still violates its right to life. to do so for such as simple and substitutable need such as food is immoral.,"eating 'happy meat' i.e. produced with less suffering is still discrimination, because we would not eat happy meat from e.g. humans or dogs. killing a happy person e.g. a pig or human in order to eat him or her, remains a violation of the right not to be used as a means against one's will."
Attack,safe spaces limit the free speech of others while doing nothing to enhance the free speech of minorities.,safe spaces do not infringe anyone's right to speech; one is free to leave the safe space if they wish to say something potentially offensive.
Attack,capitalism defined as free markets are the only properly regulated economies .,"free markets do not exist outside of the environment of centralised states, their contractual frameworks, economic and financial networks."
Support,"if they have been prioritised, or even generally treated differently from the general public, that will put them at a degree of separation rather than assist integration.",people unable to obtain jobs are likely to blame ex convicts for their predicament if there is an employment program in place that prioritises ex convicts.
Support,there are many christian miracles that cannot be explained by science.,the miracle of the sun at fatima is proof of intervention of the virgin mary in history.
Attack,"a cashless society is a step towards dematerialization like everything, including payments, happen through a phone .",a 100 cashless system has too many requirements to be reasonably feasible.

Attack,"individuals should be expected to have the moral fortitude to not follow hateful ideas and movements. if they resort to hateful actions, that is when they should be punished.","if the individual spouting off hate speech does not accept responsibility for their actions, they might blame the victim for the hate they receive."
Attack,there are too many different types of meditation. it's hard to know which could be beneficial.,the fact there are so many different types of meditation may open up more potential uses for it.
Attack,"the effect of voter fatigue can be diminished by holding referendums on the same day as elections, thereby ensuring that people who turn up primarily to vote in referendums will probably also end up voting in elections.","the combination of election and referendum has a higher risk that protest votes against a government have a spillover effect on the referendum, and as a consequence distort the referendum's outcome."
Attack,"few fans cried out for star wars, its characters or storylines to be deconstructed, re imagined, or otherwise 'fixed' beforehand. this is why the movie has been commonly met with surprise, shock, and anger.","movies series in which characters and storylines are not deconstructed, re imagined or otherwise fixed, quickly fall into tedium which ill fits a series of movies as innovative as star wars."
Support,"early christians say that jesus rising from the tomb on the third day is predicted by scripture. if they believed it was predicted by scripture, as the scripture predates jesus, they would have predicted jesus would rise from the dead even before he did.","in luke 24: but we had hoped that he was the one to redeem israel. yes, and besides all this, it is now the third day since this happened. and thus it is written, that the christ should suffer and on the third day rise from the dead."

Support,"freedom of religion is a fundamental western principle. in islam, it's not. in for example the qur'an, surah 5:33 , opposers of islam are to be killed or crucified.","similar things are written about apostates, multiple times."
Attack,neither did the colonies need economic improvement nor did colonization result in economic improvement.,"prior to the arrival of the british, india was a prosperous economy, but it was still ruled by the mughal empire ."
Attack,it is unreasonable to assume absent evidence that someone who identifies as religiously affiliated is not a believer.,"suggesting something is reasonably possibly, when the evidence is insufficient to rule out that possibility, is not making an assumption. especially when the data shows that only a minority percentage of the surveyed scientists in every region surveyed, except one, have no doubt in the existence of a god."
Support,"humans have rational capacities that animals lack. therefore, our behaviour is not solely determined by our biological impulses and so, can be socially constructed.","philosophers, like aristotle and immanuel kant p. 1 , argue that the humans' special characteristic is the capability to reason, which liberates them from many of the laws that govern the behaviour of animals."
Attack,"some families will have amassed far more than others because they would have worked hard to earn it, it is not an unfair advantage if it is the result of hard work.",slave ownership allowed some families to amass more wealth than others.
Support,the cost of abortion can be prohibitive for women in some places.,"in the us, those below or at the federal poverty line are three times less likely to have an abortion due to lack of funds as compared to the more affluent in society."
Support,"god allows murder and rape to happen when he could do something about it, as opposed to merely atone for it, as if it were inevitable.",it's the difference between paying for something you broke and just preventing it from becoming broken in the first place.
Attack,"religion is needed for morality, though the traditional notion of god is not.",empathy is instinctive. the urge to help someone who is suffering often does not require a conscious decision. people will just feel an urge to help.
Support,"all over the world people believe all sorts of things, that doesn't make them any more true.","a common example is the flat earth theory. while many people still believe the earth is flat, studies have proven otherwise."
Attack,"the process required to change such documentation is both lengthy and intrusive. an individual who wants to be medically certified as trans in the uk is required to have lived as their identified gender for at least two years, undergo assessment by medical experts, and pay a 140 fee.","given that trans identity is a central aspect of many trans people's lives, being medically certified would be worth the effort."
Support,teaching empathy is often a partisan issue; conservatives are likely to particularly oppose the subject being taught in school.,conservatives often decry hypersensitivity and snowflake behaviour in younger generations. they may oppose teaching empathy on the grounds that it could worsen these tendencies.
Attack,"atheism is arguably nothing more than a disinclination toward blind faith. the faithful posit god is real but all five senses indicate otherwise. the burden of proof then falls on the faithful, since god is not arguing his case. atheists need no justification.",all positions require justification in discourse. even a disinclination toward blind faith which isn't widely considered the definition of atheism demands justification.
Attack,"how much meat to produce will be solved automatically by supply and demand. if food is scarce, prices will rise, and the most efficient forms of production will be favored.","in order for this to apply, supply needs to be limited. right now the amazon rainforest is being cleared to make room for cattle. this is not efficient or sustainable."
Attack,the ontological argument shows that there must be some being that has the properties traditionally ascribed to god. we can't abandon those properties and still be talking about that being.,the thesis considers a hypothetical god with certain properties. the question of whether such a god actually exists is irrelevant to whether such a concept is logically consistent.
Support,christianity christianity teaches that the purpose of life is to love god and to love others .,"christianity posits that faith is the only way through which a person can attain eternal life , failing which they would be condemned to hell. therefore, from a pragmatic perspective, it makes sense for people to prioritize living a life of faith."
Attack,"the oecd comparable countries are vastly smaller, far less populous, and have far more homogeneous populations than the united states. the us has a far more complex problem to solve than the average oecd nation.","population size has nothing to do with the efficiency of a government program. if you have a larger population, you have more paying taxes into the system, which means you have more funding to cover more people. the funding pool expands with the size of the population."
Support,teaching life skills in school would ensure the acquisiton of important practical skills is not dependent on individual parents.,some people don't have active parents or guardians who can teach them life skills.
Attack,there is a hypothesis called the god gene that asserts that humans are predisposed towards spirituality and religion due to a specific gene.,a biological predisposition to some kind of belief does not prove the validity of this belief.
Attack,"p1. if god doesn t exist, there is no basis or foundation for moral values.","it may not be sensible to talk in terms of values . instead, there are better or worse ways to navigate through conceptual social space, with morality being that which is aligned with particular goals."
Attack,"these dangerous goods would still be in the earth's gravitational field and thus could plummet back down, causing natural disasters.","a space elevator has it's endpoint at the geostationary orbit . this means that one could deposit payloads in this case waste into said orbit or it could be propelled farther, like out of the solar system for example."
Attack,religious organizations make it easier for people to come together and help their communities.,having people go to sectarian centers to foster community also fosters division between those sects that would not be there had they all just gone to a universal community center.
Support,there are people who do not conform to the gender binary.,the existence of more than two genders in numerous cultures disproves the absolute claim that only two genders exist.
Support,in many cases land is best suited or only suited to farming meat; meaning that converting it to crops would be less efficient and thus cause greater environmental harms.,"we can raise animals in terrain that we cannot raise vegetables or grain. areas such as steep slopes and high mountain sides can be successfully grazed in a sustainable, ecological way, but cannot be used for growing vegetables or grains without energy intensive and destructive modifications."
Attack,"in monuments, venues, and sites of historical importance, it may be neither architecturally feasible nor permissible to reconstruct, rebuild, and redesign bathrooms. making existing bathrooms open to all genders may be preferable.","renovating heritage buildings and monuments based on modern considerations could distort their history . specifically, redesigning gender segregated bathrooms into gender neutral ones could erase the history of gender segregation."
Support,low income countries also contribute to conflicts that result in refugee flows and therefore have an obligation to take these refugees in.,"wars in the democratic republic of congo drc , sparked by regional genocide and previous warfare, displaced many individuals. today, more than 600,000 refugees and asylum seekers from the drc are in other african countries."

Support,feminism does not always advocate for women being included in the draft.,"the reasons for this vary, from the army being seen as a traditionally hierarchical, male dominated institution promoting destructive forms of power to the fact of anti militarism and feminism often correlating."
Attack,people who go against religious teaching often face violent persecution.,most countries have laws to protect people who go against religious beliefs.
Attack,"as jesus was crucified at passover, which always falls in a full moon, there couldn't have been an eclipse during his crucifixion. thus, phlegon was referring to events at a different time.","if the event truly was miraculous as the bible claims, the eclipse very well could have happened during a full moon even if this isn't normally possible."
Attack,being in pride can be the beginning of unifying the lgbtq community with police.,it is ideal that the queer community and police stay disunified. queer liberation is incompatible with western style policing.
Support,historical accounts of different events in the new testament are often confused to be contradictions.,"matthew 21:12 , where jesus cleanses the temple the day he enters jerusalem, and mark 11:11, 15 , where jesus cleanses the temple the day after he entered jerusalem are two separate events . both matthew and mark mention jesus going in and out of the temple several times."
Support,"the bioelectrical circuits in a human brain and the electrical neural networks of agi will likely be very similar , suggesting that agi could have comparable conscious experiences to human beings.",artificial neural networks can train using data and are a precursor for advanced ai. this shows that artificial beings can gain skills through experience.
Support,all laws related to children's health and safety apply in schools. this protects their bodily integrity from a young age.,the organized and monitored environment typical of schools makes it easier to prevent more serious violations of children's integrity and to quickly and efficiently address minor infractions.
Support,"people have different motivations for committing crimes and those motivations will not be met by committing crimes in the virtual world. therefore, they are still likely to commit crimes.","many crimes, if successfully pulled off, would likely give them more time in the virtual reality."
Support,"humans are hardwired to empathise and demonstrate these skills from a young age . this is because empathy helps people to associate others with themselves, and build community ties.","the presence of mirror neurons suggests that mimicry and empathy are inherent to the human experience, playing a key role in learning and the transmission of culture ."
Support,citizens can easily be empowered with the knowledge of the direct and indirect impacts of their actions on the climate. this can be done through formal education and public campaigns p. 8 .,it is easier to educate people now than ever because of the increase in global internet penetration .

Support,"carbon taxes may be harmful for both consumers and businesses, as they drive up costs and reduce people's disposable income. this would harm businesses' bottom line as consumers buy less.","initially predicted to cost families 200 a year, increased carbon taxes in the 2018 irish budget ended up costing families 500 in 2022, with predictions for further increase. this is unfeasible for lower income families."
Attack,following the baháʼí faith has positive benefits for the individual.,"in many places, bahá'ís remain subject to severe persecution ."
Support,some places have instituted partial bans that only include specific types of cars.,some places have instituted selective car bans based on emissions standards.

Support,gender quotas can lead to a more hostile working environment.,"gender quotas will encourage women to exhibit sexist attitudes towards other women, which is counter productive."
Support,"if we can establish objectivity, and we can discern between good and bad, we therefore have all the ingredients to discern an objective morality.","if we have the ability to discern objective morality, then whether or not we have detected it is moot, as we have the ability to filter for it. that filter is proof enough that there exists objective moral rules."
Attack,making disciples is a prerequisite to baptizing and teaching them to obey everything commanded by christ. infants can't be disciples.,this interpretation would mean that people become disciples before being taught.
Support,"from the moment they are born, monarchs are usually better trained and educated to deal with political affairs than most politicians.","monarchs are likely to receive an international education, attend the best schools and choose degrees related to their royal duties."
Support,"it is estimated that if greenhouse gas pollution is not checked, sea levels will rise another 3 or 4 feet on average per year, which is a significant amount.","greenhouse gases have continued to increase rapidly in 2022 , which shows that we are unlikely to take the measures needed to stop seal level rise."
Support,the level of support for animal rights is not sufficient to ensure effective boycotts. this indicates that people do not believe that zoos are immoral.,"in the us, only 32 of people believe that animals should enjoy similar rights to humans."
Attack,a ubi would improve working capabilities and conditions.,companies could use a ubi as a justification to offer lower wages to their workers.

Support,"tech is a very male dominated field ; as such, women should be given the tools and coding skills they need to break into it.",women led firms receive just 2 of venture capital in silicon valley.
Attack,the human drive to pursue pleasure generally seeks immediate gratification and often promotes behaviors that are not in the person's best long term interests.,"even if seeking immediate pleasure is a strong drive in humans, our ability to resist urges or temper desires suggests that free will exists in some sense."
Support,"some renewables, such as solar and wind, are not persistently able to provide power. this makes them unsuitable for base load power generation.","in remote regions, such as western canada, solar energy only works for an average of a few hours per day ."
Support,the four horsemen are unrepresentative of broader society as they are all heterosexual white men .,the four horsemen all came from predominantly christian although some non practising backgrounds.
Attack,"achieving peace in society takes time, as there are often path dependencies that encourage some behaviours over others. thus, the pursuit of widespread empathy may pay a dividend in the future.","widespread peace is impossible to achieve. people, no matter how empathetic they are, cannot be expected to trade off justice with the demands of a quiet life."
Attack,there is ample proof that confirmation bias is a very human flaw in our search for knowledge.,"more than ample, but history is replete with the public scoffing at new scientific theories because they violate common sense, which is the most pernicious form of self bias, only to be proved that what was counter intuitive is in fact true."
Support,"the rights and responsibilities of adulthood are conferred broadly between 18 21, when individuals are deemed to be sufficiently responsible.",age restrictions on body modification procedures are in place because minors are not deemed fit to provide meaningful consent.
Support,"making it mandatory adds the unnecessary costs of regulation, enforcement, and policing.","it would be hard or almost impossible to maintain and enforce such laws, not to mention them causing a gross intrusion of privacy, integrity, and personal choice."
Support,"many things can cause harm to the body, but we do not ban all of them.","many substances cause harm to the body when consumed improperly including fast food and sugar , but this is not a reason to ban them."
Attack,football broadcasting rights are critical to the business model for traditional broadcasters trying to compete with streaming services.,traditional broadcasting's problems are sufficiently robust that not even football broadcasting rights can save them.
Attack,existential threats come from space. exploring space helps humanity better understand and prepare.,important and existential threats also come from the oceans since a large amount of food depends on ocean life flourishing. the great oxidation event mass extinction was due to changes in marine organisms and algal blooms were involved in extinction events. climate change in oceans such as marine heatwaves or plastic pollution effects on phytoplankton could represent more tangible earlier future problems.
Attack,"given that the brain is made of atoms, which can be simulated in physics if all else fails, the idea that a non biological ai is impossible requires literal magic in that souls must exist and be necessary for intelligence .",it could be impossible to simulate all atoms like that.

Attack,money spent on ocean exploration is better spent on humanitarian pursuits.,"this argument could be used to shut down most forms of scientific research, as there will always be a more pressing humanitarian concern that deserves solving."
Attack,"in contrast, republics treat the presidents and prime ministers as regular residents for tax purposes and do not apply a highly preferential tax free regime.","the prime minister of the uk is eligible for a 'prime ministerial expenses deduction' of 20,000 tax free income, which no other citizen receives."
Attack,a culture of political correctness paves the way for authoritarianism.,there are many contributors to authoritarianism; political correctness does not carry that full load.

Support,"when minimum wage doesn't increase, minimum wage earners, get poorer over time. the 7.25 hr current nationally, could have purchased over 11 of the same goods, a few years back. it was better pay then. wages must outpace inflation to improve one's standard of living, otherwise they get poorer.","it is often argued that we can improve our wages through effort, determination, and self improvement, but because of inflation, some of those things must be required just to break even. stable effort for stable pay makes you poorer over time; we are already climbing uphill."
Support,meat analogues based on soy protein or wheat gluten are getting close to imitating the taste and texture of real meat and have been part of the food culture in places such as taiwan for a long time.,"lab grown meat is predicted to be on offer in a restaurant within a few years. inasmuch as the normalization of lab grown meat lowers the bar for eating non animal meat thereby exerting pressure on animal meat eaters all else equal and inasmuch as quantified, aggregated predictions serve as evidence for the likelihood of an event, a prediction like this one that a restaurant will serve cultured meat by 2021 supports the eating meat is wrong argument."
Support,"for example, the best possible world may include human beings with free will, and free will may require the possibility of choosing evil.",in the best of possible worlds people have free will and moral responsibility. these imply the existence of evil.
Attack,"this argument is highly dependent on the current technology. with the help of great minds around the world, promoted by immigration into the country, such problems can be solved.","although this may be true, 'great minds' do not necessarily have to come from immigrants. we can always import technologies from other countries without the need to locate foreign researchers into the country."
Support,school uniforms provide a sense of shared pride and identity.,students in mandatory uniform schools reported significantly more positive perceptions of belonging in their school community than those at non uniform schools.
Support,"this may be a benefit, as human raised livestock is often kept in atrocious conditions, and also has negative environmental impacts. farming also has negative impacts on humans.",the common practices underlying the production of meat massive livestock farming are unethical.
Support,whether the system in question is novel or more optimal is what is under dispute.,"if an argument for a system is an argument for socialism, that implies that the system is socialism."
Support,obesity induces companies to invest in gmo genetically modified organisms research that can mitigate environmental threats.,"because obese people consume more, there will be a rise in demand for foodstuff products. to fulfill this demand, gmo research will be necessary."
Support,"in the context of cultural art taken from indigenous groups, this undermines their ability to preserve their art.",this could be seen as disrespectful to that indigenous group.
Attack,a nationally representative survey conducted in march 2017 found that 61 of us voters opposed religious exemption laws.,"the survey focussed exclusively on the case of abortion, which is only a very small part of religious exemptions debate. it does not reveal the general level of support for religious exemption laws as a whole."
Support,the pressure to be politically correct insulates marginalized groups from insensitive remarks and acts of bullying.,"bullying and offensive language could inflict mental distress on individuals, potentially leading to severe consequences such as suicide in extreme scenarios."
Attack,it is not claimed in the grandgrandparent claim that the system is lacking is indicating that a worthwhile and realistically achievable alternative exists. it's a strawman and grandparent con essentially mute instead of heavily impacting the parent.,"the claim in question must implicitly argue from that, otherwise it has no impact on its parent ."
Attack,any decision by society on how to treat animals should not be based on religion nor any other non falsifiable belief.,"any treatment is based on a belief. fair or unfair is only opinion, not scientific fact."
Support,"orphan works , which are copyrighted works for which rightholders cannot be contacted, can make accessing historical and cultural records extremely difficult.",a conservative estimate put the number of orphan works in the uk in 2009 to be about 25 million p. 6 .
Support,spirituality and religion are often too interrelated to make a meaningful separation from either concept.,"a spiritual movement can be traced back to religious roots, diverging but not fully separating."
Attack,that the default of a misaligned ai would be to kill everyone is unsubstantiated and not something that is reasonable to assume.,"the fact that what we that is, people concerned about misaligned ai mean by misaligned ai normally refers to an ai that kills everyone is true regardless, so this objection is immaterial in this context."
Support,the systems traditionally used in mandatory schooling can be detrimental to children's education.,"schools primarily group children by age rather than by ability, which does a disservice to both advanced and developing students."
Attack,"rights do not exist in a vacuum and thus cannot be weighed in abstract terms. instead, evaluating which rights are more important should be judged on a case by case basis.","certain rights, like bodily autonomy or freedom of choice , are more important than others because they allow humans to choose how to live their own lives."
Attack,"if we don't even know what we can do to avert ai x risk, this is raises the concern that we may not know what we have to do until after it is too late to do it. that should motivate an urgency to learn, not a passivity about the risk.",something not being a global priority does not mean one is passive about it. and it is about that we can't know before some other developments occurred.
Attack,"the 2nd law of thermodynamics states that all things fall toward decay in a closed system, unless an outside force acts within the system. in our universe, the outside force would be god.",the universe may well not be a closed system in the thermodynamic sense.

Support,education should not become too fixated on employment; just because a subject is relevant to a particular job does not mean it should have a place in schools.,children should not become focused on a particular career too early in their lives: they should be presented with a wide range of options which they can choose from when they are more mature.
Support,national security is best served by the most able bodied; equal conscription would not be a good strategy as women have much less strenuous pt requirements that could lower total military effectiveness.,"at marine boot camp, 3 out of 4 women fail to meet combat standards . this suggests that women are not as capable as men in this regard."
Support,"technology now exists that can track enemies without the need for a tracking device on the enemy ship, even after they have jumped millions of light years away. this is an incredible plot contrivance that breaks the principles of space combat and retreat in the star wars saga, and poses a problem for future creators.",it is not definite that the hyperspace tracking mentioned by jyn during rogue one means tracking enemy ships through space . the only evidence for this is a now deleted tweet from one of the writers. the term is too throwaway and ambiguous to be ascribed concrete meaning.
Support,"organized religion is among the most influential factors in the construction of group identity p. 197 . by creating in groups and out groups, organized religion limits people's opportunities to engage fully with themselves and others outside of the context of religious identity.","the feminist movement itself is damaged by such divisions , as individuals with common cause in the liberation of women are socially and ideologically driven apart by religious identity."
Support,while the socialist calculation problem is clearly relevant it does not necessarily and likely does not sufficiently correspond to the problem of a novel more optimal socioeconomic system.,"already in its name, the socialist calculation problem assumes both a socialist economy and top down or central calculation. both of these concepts are deeply flawed and are fairly unlikely to be applied in a more optimal novel socioeconomic system as is."

Attack,"income is inversely related to fertility, as demonstrated by the fact that wealthier nations have lower birth rates . therefore, optimizing market forces to increase income would render coercive population control unnecessary.","economic and income growth can be unpredictable and slow. it is possible that optimizing market forces would take too long to make a difference to problems caused by overpopulation, such as climate change."

Support,"there are many alien abduction reports. a 1995 study found: abduction accounts are consistent, physical symptoms are indicative of actual abductions, experiencers show signs of ptsd, experiences are shared within families and across generations, children s abduction experiences suggest veridicality, abductions occur to the same individuals repeatedly not only once, they help explain the covert nature of ufo activity, and multiple witness cases indicate a real event.","after publishing the book communion about uap related experiences, author whitley strieber received many letters of people claiming to also have experienced similar things. a subset of estimated 10,000 of these letters are stored in the impossible archive of rice university , open for research. several people claimed the book cover struck them due to their alien abductions, including immunologist garry nolan and dr. col. john blitch ."

Attack,"morality cannot be objective , that is without personal belief or feelings. we frequently have caveats on actions which would 'normally' be immoral. killing a human, in most cultures, is immoral, however, killing a human in self defence is often, though not always, moral.","killing in self defense isn't a crime, but that doesn't make it moral. claiming anecdotal cases of exemptions isn't a moral judgement, it's a legal judgement."

Attack,"unlike wild animals, farmed animals are born explicitly due to human action. while we may have a duty to ensure that their lives are not unnecessarily cruel, it is not immoral to kill them for our own ends given they would not have existed otherwise.",the farming process is far from cruelty free. as unanimous ethical farming seems to be impossible in our global capitalist climate the easiest way to ensure ethical treatment of animals is to take part in a widespread movement to stop supporting farmed meat.
Support,"global influence is central to protecting and promoting us interests, both domestically and internationally. as such, the us must protect the interests of its international partners.",acting as a reliable partner to its geopolitical allies is essential for the us to maintain its soft power .
Attack,"in 2018, theresa may committed to giving the nhs an extra 20bn a year by 2023 .","nhs hospital activity is set to rise by at least 2.7 by 2023. once wage growth is factored in, theresa may's proposed budget will not be sufficient to cater to the increased demand faced by the nhs hospitals."
Support,"requires a secure time and means after the election for the candidates to trade, which could be costly and uncertain.","asset violates one person, one vote , because the candidates have multiple votes to trade."
Attack,it is possible to resolve these contradictions by receiving spiritual guidance from those who are closer to god.,"even catholic spiritual leaders disagree about the teachings. therefore, they are unlikely to offer the clarification sought."
Support,it is difficult to imagine how a successor for the ed could be found and or selected.,there are no clear and generally agreed upon criteria based on which a successor could be looked for and selected.
Support,"this is also a direct continuation of the final scene from the force awakens, where rey offers anakin's lightsaber to luke and luke himself is visibly emotional that someone followed his map and found him. going straight from that to him apathetically discarding the lightsaber is a non sequitur not meant as a compliment .","luke would not have accepted the lightsaber from rey in the first place if he was only going to throw it away. the tone of episode vii and the tone of episode viii were worlds apart, even though they were the same scene they even used some of the same footage ."

Attack,putin has a firm grip on the russian political system.,autocratic regimes like putin's are hardly stable.
Support,the roman catholic church has the wealth to fund more generous financial compensation programmes for priests.,the vatican is estimated to own up to billions of euros worth of assets.
Attack,astrology is useful to many people who find comfort and community by following the practice.,"these are not the first claim of usefulness of astrology. first claims are character description and future events predictions. it fails in both, so it's not a valid practice. using it for another purpose is not relevant."
Attack,sweden didn't have drastic measures in place in 2020 and the health system did not become overwhelmed with patients.,"in december 2020, stockholm requested extra help from the government as its hospitals filled up with covid 19 patients, and cases and deaths increased."
Attack,having a good physique can help people overcome their insecurities. steroids can often help this endeavour.,normalizing steroid use can affect people's beauty ideals and actually increase their levels of insecurity.
Attack,government should not intervene in the way religious organisations work. exemptions achieve the necessary separation of state and religion.,"many organizations that utilize religious exemptions are government funded . considering these organizations are funded by public taxes, they should not have the option to opt out of providing goods and services to vulnerable groups, that are part of the same public."
Attack,the inclusion of anyone who identifies as a woman into women only spaces will make them less safe.,women only spaces can make use of trained security staff or guards to maintain safety.
Support,condorcet methods would be considered superior to utilitarian methods because they would allow multiple candidates to run from one party without risk of the majority vote splitting helping the minority pathology of approval or the indifferent majority allowing the strong minority to win,"one of the biggest benefits to any voting reform is that it will allow more competition, and utilitarian methods may fail this in practice as well as in theoretical discussion , as they can result in vote splitting or low scoring among indifferent majorities."
Support,it was only after jordan had blocked off jerusalem's roads and cut off their access to water that israel responded and captured the city.,israel tried to keep jordan out of the war with egypt to avoid fighting a two front war.
Attack,media reporting of the death toll of soldiers and the suffering of those involved in the war is likely to convince voters to have an anti war stance.,citizens often support war efforts when they see them as just.

Attack,"chatgpt itself is a business, owned by openai, through a partnership with microsoft . if either of them were to go out of business or shut the project down, it could cascade into disastrous economic results for thousands of individual companies and small businesses.","openai is investing more into chatgpt, ensuring that the business will be successful for years to come."
Attack,animals may feel discomfort due to illness and disease that can happen in factory farming.,"animals in husbandry are well fed and medicated, their quality of life is significantly better than wild counterparts."
Attack,the cited article states that what differentiated these children from the rest was partially their own behaviors : avoiding teen pregnancy and staying in school.,the article states that behavior is a small part of it but a larger amount of their outcomes were out of their control.
Support,porn is ethical when all participants fully and freely consent to engaging in the production.,"the subjectivity of morality means that what is considered moral is a collective social product. therefore, if all the people involved in an exercise consent to engage in it, it is moral within that context."
Support,"the bible preaches messages of peace , which form the foundation of christian pacifism .",the teachings of jesus and the new testament authors promote peace and non violence .
Support,forcing a country to take in a quota of refugees undermines its national sovereignty.,"part of being a sovereign state means having control over one's borders. by forcing eu members to take in a certain quota of refugees, the eu is infringing on the sovereignty of those countries."
Attack,"the portrayal of gender equality in video games can conceal actual gender inequality which persists in society. this is because the portrayal of gender equality in video games may lead people to believe that gender equality has been achieved in real life, when that isn't the case.",part of gender equality ge is seeing ge portrayed in video games. not portraying ge because people might take that portrayal as indicating that ge has been achieved would thus actually prevent ge from being achieved in full.
Attack,jewish spirituality is compatible with the realities of human life and does not place unreasonable restrictions on the lifestyle or emotions of followers.,many traditional and orthodox branches of judaism are largely incompatible with modern society p. 73 .
Attack,there are now no professions barred to women in western society.,"not formally, but many are still hostile or unapproachable for women."
Attack,"in 2014, the oecd spent about 135 billion on foreign aid.","the amounts that high income countries spend on foreign aid are negligible, relative to what those countries could spend. in 2013, only 5 members of the oecd were donating more than 0.7 of their gdp."
Support,"performing the circumcision on the 8th day, as prescribed by religious law is in the best interest of the infant. waiting for them to be able to consent would risk something going horribly wrong in the meantime and it being too late.","for this same reason, we give vaccines and immunizations before the child is old enough to consent to them."
Support,"there is no point in training a workforce in skills that may not lead to high paying and secure jobs, and there is no guarantee that coding skills will lead to such jobs.","coding will soon be an outdated skill, and schools should not teach redundant skills."
Support,"it would be possible for judas to first hang himself, and after a while for the rope to rot and snap, causing judas's corpse to fall onto the field and spill its intestines.",this makes sense because it is far more likely that the guts of a rotting corpse would fall out after falling headlong than the guts of a living person.
Attack,"it is unlikely voters will actually dislike utilitarianism in practice; it is only a matter of convincing them to try a method with a simple and plausible majoritarian strategy, and allow them to, themselves, adjust to a societal equilibrium where honesty and utilitarianism beat majority rule.","this adjustment will not happen without some voters being honest, and therefore it is still dishonest to tell all voters that this strategy is likely, when the desired and predicted outcome is utilitarianism, and when the refutation to majority rule is simple enough that it can be explained to voters and easily spread."
Attack,there is nothing wrong with exploring 'alternative explanations' if the explanations in question are backed up by evidence. observing the natural world has garnered the human race information that a belief in a supernatural entity simply doesn't provide.,"the fact that humans have learned from studying nature doesn't support athiesm but rather supports the existence of god because the integrated complexity, efficiency and precision found in nature suggest the work of a superior intelligence."
Support,the barriers to entry are too high to ensure competition in the health sector. oligopolies are therefore more likely to take over and distort the free market.,one of the major barriers in the us is a certificate of need . local or state governments need to provide permission to open a facility. they are easily lobbied by incumbent providers to stifle competition.
Support,atheism has been accused of having a sexism problem.,one of its probable factors is that men are much more likely than women to be atheists . p.75
Attack,allowing disparities in social capital to emerge at a young age deprives children of the right to an education that puts them on a level playing field with their peers.,"it is less important that opportunity is equal, but that it reaches a high minimum standard for everyone. banning private schools does not ensure that such a standard is reached, and, thus, is an ineffective policy solution."
Attack,"that is a study funded by the john templeton foundation , a pro religious group, and therefore bias is a real and probable threat to the study in question .",the study is peer reviewed. accusations of bias are totally unfounded and based on nothing but speculation and one's desire to see the study disproven absent evidence.
Support,"china often uses these development projects as a way to trap other countries with weaker economies into predatory relationships, demanding concessions and allowances when these countries default on their infrastructure loans.","china is aiming to take over the rights to a kenyan seaport , in the event that the countries fails to repay loans given by china for infrastructure projects."
Support,there is considerable debate as to whether the nhs currently has a problem with efficiency.,"the average length of hospital stay, which is viewed as a key efficiency indicator, is a day shorter in the uk than the eu average. a short stay is viewed as an indicator of efficiency."
Attack,"large preferences for minority cultures, for example, can put people in environments where they cannot compete effectively. this reinforces negative stereotypes about their competency.","research shows no significant difference in work performance between employees entering jobs via affirmative action and those entering via traditional hiring practices. therefore, the premise that preferences put people into environments where their work quality is inferior is unsupported."
Attack,"lawful protests should be allowed. protesting is a constitutional right of the people. as long as the participants are protesting lawfully and are on public property, protesting in front of abortion clinics should be allowed.","however, these protests might mean harassment , which is not a human right."
Attack,"the russian military has over 109,000 personnel in reserve, which is double the size of the wagner group.",the wagner group has indicated plans to recruit more soldiers in the future.
Support,corporal punishment can normalise the use of violence for children.,"as children are in their formative stages , their perceptions are influenced by these interactions and may grow to have the wrong views about the use of violence."
Support,the islamic approach to transgender issues is based upon problematic interpretations and understandings of gender non conformity.,"the categorization of transgender identity as a mental or behavioral disorder , such as psychological hermaphroditism, is inconsistent with modern understandings of gender p. 93 94 ."
Attack,"political correctness is crucial to the development of humane social norms, progress, and cultural mores. destabilizing the status quo through a strong pc movement allows society to integrate better moral ideas into its value system over time.","by definition political correctness establishes a 'correct norm' and one way or another reinforces it. reinforcing a norm stifles discussion that deviates from that norm, thus slowing other social reform."
Attack,musk himself is known for sometimes behaving in harmful and questionable ways on twitter.,"musk has one of the most followed twitter accounts. if the majority of people believed he was behaving in a harmful way, he wouldn't be as popular."
Support,there are no plausible alternatives: mass data storage has unique security benefits that mere real time mass surveillance or more targeted surveillance will never be able to provide.,most intelligence agencies of other countries collect a lot of data of both their own citizens and foreign ones. it is necessary for american intelligence agencies to follow modern intelligence techniques.
Support,teaching empathy in schools could foster a more peaceful and tolerant society.,"a lack of empathy in the early stages of life leads to intolerance , which perpetuates societal inequalities based on race, sex, or other factors."
Support,"simply having a workplace policy on wellbeing and mental health that outlines how to raise the issue with management, can be a good start towards helping employees.",this can provide employees and managers with a framework of how to tackle conversations about important mental health issues.
Attack,"in many cultures, outwardly asking a stranger for sex is frowned upon.",cultural attitudes to sex are notoriously misaligned with actual sexual behaviours. embracing the realities of sexual behaviour may have positive benefits for society.
Attack,the fact that something is allowed does not mean it ought to be endorsed.,this distinction may not be immediately clear to passive observers who attribute an overly paternal role to the state.
Attack,the fact that jews criticise israel does not justify the criticism of israel by external actors.,"under the principles of freedom of thought and free expression , everyone is entitled to criticise israel, regardless of whether jews criticise it."
Support,social media is a necessary avenue to finding peer support in recovery.,"social media can allow people to voice their problems and seek advice anonymously, which can be useful to those who are embarrassed or confused by their illness."
Support,"religion is not the motivation, it only appeals to existing human values. these values would lead to selfless acts without religion.","experts suggest that those who are more charitable, are not so for their religious or humanists beliefs, but based on the social connections and ties they have with charities."
Attack,teachers should encourage students to use gadgets for educational purposes only while in the classroom.,"enforcing this rule would be incredibly difficult, as teachers would have to monitor the mobile phone activity of a whole classroom of students."
Support,catholic teachings are often praised for their strong moral framework and emphasis on social justice.,circumstances of themselves cannot change the moral quality of acts themselves; they can make neither good nor right an action that is in itself evil. paragraph 1754 is a teaching allowing some leniency without absolving the crime.
Attack,"omniscience and omnipotence cannot be used to describe one entity. if an entity is omniscient, that means it has no limits to knowledge, and what can be known. if it is also omnipotent, then there is no limit to the capability of said being. an omniscient being would have no reason to change its mind, being that it knows all outcomes, but then that would be an action it is not capable of, meaning it cannot be omnipotent. if it can change its mind, then it could not foresee that outcome.","it is true an omniscient being could not change his mind because he foreknows all his decisions. god doesn t decide anything except in relations with temporal beings and even these are not a decision as he foreknew them. but there is no contradiction between this and omnipotence. omnipotence is recognized by most theologians as the power and ability to do anything that is logically possible. if changing his mind is logically impossible, then god changing his mind would be an imperfection."
Support,pro anorexia pro ana and pro bulimia 'pro mia websites promote the illness as a lifestyle and encourage extreme thinness through web pages filled unrealistically thin bodies.,"research shows that although there are more anorexia related videos on youtube that are informative in nature, pro anorexia videos are viewed more often and favored three times more than purely informative ones p.2 ."
Support,"a pedophile's sexual desires are a largely unchangeable aspect of their sexuality . it would be better, therefore, to prioritize teaching them coping mechanisms rather than punishing them.",pedophiles usually commit crimes due to a lack of self control . the only way to prevent this is to improve the self control of offenders.
Support,"in case of a conflict between utility and general rules of conduct, general rules should be appealed to first.",the harm caused by violating general societal rules offsets any gains in utility that could otherwise occur.
Support,"many titles signify achievement and are not chosen, they are earned accomplishments.",doctors don't choose their titles. they are awarded them when they have a phd in their field or have finished medical school.
Attack,biden is reluctant to start the medicare for all project and the health issue will grow worse.,the medicare for all act will not help because it is bad for the economy and lowers healthcare quality.
Support,merely pinning the cause on code being difficult to initially work with is not a viable reason to define why people would drop out.,"current programming curriculums aren't necessarily built to be fluid, which is extremely needed in order to learn programming."
Support,the existence of religion allows for the criminalization of atheists and agnostics.,"religious people often antagonize atheists for offending their beliefs , whereas in non religious contexts, atheists may face less opposition."
Attack,the moscow project analyzed and found a long history of business deals between president trump and putin .,president trump was a businessman dealing with many countries. business deals with a country are not suspicious.

Attack,the sexualization of women in professional environments has a damaging impact on their perceived competence and actual achievement.,"sexual objectification is strongly driven by physical attractiveness . therefore, in a genderless society, physically attractive people will still be objectified."
Attack,the decision to have school uniforms should be chosen by the school itself.,"standardized school rules has a strong precedent, with many tests, curricula, and teaching training regimes being standardized throughout countries or districts."
Attack,"rudolf bultmann, one of the most sceptical scholars this century has seen, wrote back in 1926:",rudolf bultmann was not skeptical by any reasonable standards. the man was born into a christian family and was a christian his entire life to call this man one of the most skeptic scholars of the century is blatantly false.
Attack,"the more skills that people have to learn to participate in the workforce, the harder it will be for them to maintain jobs.","if it becomes increasingly hard for the majority of society to maintain a job, there will be a stronger societal push for the government to provide a universal basic income ubi ."
Support,iconoclasm serves only the narrow interests of the activists engaged in its pursuit. the motivations for iconoclasm are rarely the removal and denial of admonition .,"removing iconography does not erase the past, but it does impoverish the future. if someone has a problem with historical icons, they have the problem, not the icon."
Support,"onan engaged in the contraceptive act multiple times before god killed him, which means this was persistent disobedience.","genesis 38:9 says, ...so whenever he slept with his brother s wife, he spilled his semen on the ground... the use of whenever implies this happened multiple times."
Attack,"medicine and law both require years of training and learning, whereas parenting typically comes naturally to people.","parenting does not come naturally to everyone. for example, adults who were victims of child abuse may struggle."
Support,acquiring information about gender and sexuality may help teachers belonging to traditional or more restrictive societies be introduced to these realities.,"traditional and restrictive societies, such as those prohibiting gay marriage , are disproportionately harmful to not only lgbtq adolescents, but all adolescents. thus, such societies need better informed and sensitized teachers more than inclusive societies."
Attack,"intentions are irrelevant to outcomes. if people are harmed by these images, they should be regulated.",regulating them wouldn't change much but would only slightly limit muscular physiques to people willing and able to illegally acquire steroids.
Support,the design of gender neutral bathrooms best meets the practical needs of all users.,it may be more efficient to have one large bathroom for all genders than two smaller ones for separate genders.
Support,some software isn't available for linux and can't be run with wine or mono.,the alternatives for windows software often are either nonexistent or less user friendly.
Attack,"god created humans with a natural telos end , which provides a basis for an objective morality: the morally right action is the action which best strives towards the human telos. by creating humans with this telos, god created an objective morality which escapes the euthyphro dilemma.","the concept of telos is meaningless. nothing has or can possibly have an inherent, objective telos ."
Attack,a ban on circumcision will lead to more dangerous illegal circumcisions to meet the demand.,"circumcision in judaism is not traditionally performed by medical professionals but religious practitioners. it is those same people who would continue performing the surgery regardless of legislation. therefore, the back alley argument doesn't apply here."
Support,"this harvard medical school article discusses social factors such as work stress and hostility contributing significantly to this. as soon as women have fully entered the world of work, the health differences are most likely evened out.",men 76 are more likely to cite that work is a source of stress than women 65 .
Support,"the power of expressing complex ideas is the same for esperanto as for natural languages, as demonstrated by the amount of original esperanto literature , some of which was nominated for the nobel prize .","many famous books have been translated into esperanto, which wouldn't have been possible if it didn't express complex ideas well."
Support,"the best arguments rarely emerge through public discussions. instead, the loudest ones usually take center stage.",arguments that shock and scare people are more likely to attract their attention.
Attack,it is difficult to determine if societies are more economically successful because they are less religious or societies are less religious because they are more economically successful. the negative correlation between economic success and religiosity does not favor one conclusion over the other.,"one way or the other, there seems to be a clear link between development and religiosity and it is clear that religiosity fares better when a country is less developed."
Attack,"replicating could be far more difficult than we may think of it for robots that are operational at another planet. if there are no intelligent beings like human and advanced economies that the robots can employ as workers to replicate them, then they'd need to essentially recreate a production chain of a highly advanced economy to be able to build all the necessary materials, electronics and so on which could be extremely difficult.",this does not require them to replicate as they may also just send a very large number of probes to many different areas or e.g. all the detectable stars.
Support,yet it is not the only factor worthy of consideration. the rights of states and societies to control their borders is also a right that has to be kept in mind.,"states have a primary responsibility to cater to their own citizens by protecting them from external security and economic threats. therefore, the right of states to control their borders overrides the freedom of movement of citizens from other countries."
Attack,there have been numerous medically recorded miracle healings that science will not take into account because science works on the basis of methodological naturalism.,we don't know how it happened e.g. an otherwise unexplained healing does not let us logically conclude that it was a miraculous act of god .
Support,"in a gender unequal world, gender blindness would prove detrimental, as the unique needs of less privileged gender groups would not be acknowledged, validated, or met. therefore, the goal should be to promote gender awareness.","gender blind covid 19 policies had a disproportionately negative impact on women. stay at home orders, for example, significantly increased women's risk of domestic violence and presumably hindered their access to help from outside the home."
Attack,"a good faith reading of the text would lead one to believe the event happened, and paul is merely stating the resurrection provided the basis for the faith. by changing the motives of early christians to an obligatory position rather than an experiential position it reads like a bad faith argument aimed at forcing the narrative through the lens of it was confirmation bias.","a good faith reading would lead one to believe that paul believed in the resurrection and was encouraging others to do likewise on the basis of his testimony alone, but that testimony itself could be the product of confirmation bias. paul offers no way for someone to check if paul is right about the resurrection or not disconfirm it ."
Attack,the original founders intended for theconstitution to be rewritten every generation so they could have a say in the framework of the government.,one generation might completely contradict another.
Attack,"during ww2, the nazis sometimes relied on circumcision to identify male jews. although not as effective now as a indicator of religion amongst most western nations, it could still be used for discrimination.","attempting to prevent discrimination by forcing the victim to change whatever makes him different is discriminative in itself. an example would be forcing a homosexual person to pretend they are heterosexual in order to stop being discriminated against, which defeats the whole purpose."
Attack,quantitative results cannot be influenced by political orientation.,"the design of studies can be influenced by the scientist, such as a survey bias ."
Support,"morality is an abstract principle, independent of god. if god can be said to be moral, it is only because he follows this principle, not because he causes it or is the source of it.","p1. is something good because god wills it, or does god will something because it is good? if you say that something is good because god wills it, then what is good becomes arbitrary. but if you say that god wills something because it is good, then what is good or bad is independent of god. in that case, moral values and duties exist independently of god, which contradicts premise 1. this is the euthyphro dilemma"
Attack,the mainstream media in many countries perpetuates harmful rhetoric that often vilifies their muslim residents.,most mainstream media outlets attempt to responsibly mitigate islamophobia.
Support,there are significant ethical issues that prenatal screening of hereditary disorders has raised which run counter to the reduction of ill health in society p. 112 .,prenatal screening and selective aborting have been compared to a form of eugenics that is discriminatory against people with genetic disabilities p. 410 .

Support,uses of proskuneo in the septuagint that are preceded by a reference to bowing down consistently mean worship.,"exodus 4:31 says, ...and when they heard that the lord was concerned about them and had seen their misery, they bowed down and worshiped proskuneo ."
Support,"deuteronomy 17:14 20 says that any kings of israel must be observant of the law, where jesus changed the law significantly.","jesus abridged or abolished a number of tenets of the laws of the israelites, which are described in various scriptures as unchanging and everlasting."
Support,"sex verification checks in sports, including invasive and humiliating genital verification checks , are a violation of privacy and have proven to be both upsetting and inconsistently applied . similar checks in women only spaces are unlikely to be any different.",the principle underlying the use of testosterone testing for sex verification in sports is flawed .
Support,"in the justice league, compared to superman, every other hero is powerless.","wonder woman relies on her lasso and wrist shields, but wields no inherent powers herself."
Attack,"coding languages significantly differ between many fields, such as electronics, video games, web design, etc., and the corresponding language should be taught during higher education, depending on the field the student has chosen.",learning an easy to learn and or popular programming language like javascript or python translates to also be better able to quickly learn other programming languages and is useful across such fields. that is only sufficient reason not to teach overly specific or programming languages with modern relevance being disputed.
Attack,"unnecessary or undesirable jobs will disappear, leading to greater worker satisfaction.",part time work would vanish and many industries would loose workers.
Attack,the money that copyright protections give artists provides them with an incentive to create innovative new works.,"copyright is an obstacle to creation, as it restricts the available content one can use without losing income."
Attack,"spirituality is a part of who we are as humans, and shared spirituality with common understanding religion is the way it gets expressed in community.",spirituality in its traditional meaning is religious belief in the supernatural and or unprovable and this is not 'part of who we are' for all humans. it is not required to have this to be a human.
Attack,"regardless of her private questions about the existence of god, mother teresa publicly espoused beliefs that were consistent with the teachings of the catholic church.","mother teresa publicly espoused poverty as a virtue , both for herself and others. yet, these statements did not translate into actions in her personal life. this makes her a hypocrite."
Attack,capitalism is leading us to destruction by causing climate change.,"communism has equal need for production and output as capitalism. they need the same products, so the same products that cause climate change in capitalism would do so under communism."
Attack,"moral theories rely on, and are constructed around, our intuitions. there is no way to bypass the subjectivity of the intuitions that form the core of all moral theories and claims.","people often make morally difficult decisions in life, during which they must choose between two strongly held values. since we can only choose one option in many cases, it must be possible to resist the moral intuitiveness of some options in favor of others. therefore, some moral intuitions are defeatable, as in it is possible to be motivated to act against them , and it is possible in favor of an inter intuition principle instead."
Support,"as of 2021, 64 countries are yet to fully prohibit corporal punishment in schools.",studies indicate that children subject to corporal punishment at school have lower self esteem and academic attainment p. 13 .
Support,messi has won more individual awards than ronaldo.,the fact that ronaldo is two years older and thus has had a longer career and more opportunities to win awards emphasizes that messi is ahead of ronaldo.
Attack,"many farm animals don't have their own native, wild habitat, and removing them from their farm habitat, by releasing them into the wild would very likely result in severe environmental, and ecological disruption. many of these livestock would likely fail to survive in the wild, and others would likely displace existing species of plants and animals.",sensibly winding down animal farming would cause far less ecological damage in the long run than continuing it indefinitely.
Attack,not enough is known about the cognitive abilities of many animals to conclude that they're not equally capable of posing and contemplating questions like these.,animals do not have the capacity of rational thinking.
Support,germany's anti fascism rules provide a good case study for banning offensive speech while retaining the ability to debunk their core ideas.,germany's case shows that hateful speech can be curtailed by using the ban as a means of reinforcing the faults and harms of those ideas.
Attack,the purpose of women only spaces is to provide safety for women p. 1 ; it doesn't make sense to sacrifice the safety of trans women in order to protect cis women.,spaces that include cis women are unlikely to be as safe as spaces reserved exclusively for trans women.
Support,the cato institute is an american libertarian think tank founded as the charles koch foundation which ideology is defined as 'market liberalism ' and may be subject to conservative bias.,"the cato institute has been linked monetarily and ideologically with the us republican party, putting in questions its claimed independence ."
Attack,"a space elevator is problematic for airplanes, because it hogs air space and provides a hazard for airplanes to crash into.",airplanes could easily fly around a space elevator.
Attack,"judith jarvis thompson set up a trolley problem where the bystander can turn the trolley towards themself. if one is wary of doing this, they should not turn the track on others.",people may consider their own life to be of greater value than another's for reasons which do not contradict the belief that five people are worth more than one.
Attack,"since the resurrection was not publicly proclaimed until pentecost, there would have been ample time for the body to have been moved.","having the opportunity, 7 weeks, isn't sufficient to imbue guilt as there were also 7 weeks of time to ensure that nefarious activities were investigated and punished."
Support,"although never attempted before, by connecting computers to our brain, we could possibly directly test consciousness with ourselves by switching over to the computer, and back again. this might test consciousness properly, possibly leading to the secrets on how to create transhumanism in terms of digitizing people through mind uploading downloading.","this is possibly to achieve in reality with modern day technology, like 3d brain visualizers that take readings from a human mind and places it on the computer."
Support,"religion stands next to race, gender and sexual preference as a primary source of bigotry, which, even where it results in no specific and or deliberate malevolent acts, has still blighted humanity, destroying relationships and potential relationships.",many potential marriages have been stopped dead by differences of religion.
Attack,"creating several genders would be tantamount to removing gender from society, as there would be far too many sub categories to serve any meaningful purpose.","in a world with many genders, the concept of gender would remain important in society and be used by individuals to refer to themselves and others. this is what a genderless society seeks to overturn."
Support,"relative to the size of their respective populations and national economies, lower income countries take on a far greater number of refugees, and thus a much greater financial burden, than high income countries.","germany spent 20bn on refugees in 2016, which only constituted around 0.58 of its total gdp that year."
Attack,"unlike an adult, a small child cannot understand the implications of circumcision, and is therefore incapable of consenting to the procedure.",forcing someone to ingest vegetables violates bodily autonomy as it forces someone to do something that affects their body without consent. yet parents are able to do this all the time due to the health benefits associated with eating vegetables; the same is true of circumcision.
Attack,"removing confederate memorials will not whitewash history. we have entire cities in the united states devoted to the civil war e.g. gettysburg, manassas, etc. we can't avoid the civil war anymore than europe can deny wwi or wwii. rather, by keeping the memorials in place, we prioritize the past over plurality in present at time we need diversity most.",diversity should include representing those who served in the confederacy.
Support,"this is not a legitimate form of discussion, because it's intent is to coerce women out of abortions. this is evidenced by the tactics used by protesters, which is not that of a calm discussion but instead involves harassment and shouting.","given the alarming rate at which violence and obstruction by antiabortion protesters has risen, and the tactics employed by protesters across the nation, like threats of violence, menacing, and actual violence, or by simply harrassing patients while holding explicitly gory signs and pictures alone, the legal definition of coercion is easily met."
Support,us aid to afghanistan has been ineffectively distributed.,many officials do not have the knowledge to spend us aid wisely .

Attack,vertical farming helps decentralize food production since locals can produce more of their food in their own gardens .,"decentralized, local food production is not an unique or inherent benefit aspect of vertical farming. other methods of small scale agriculture and urban farming can provide the same functionality. we do not need to resort to vertical farming just to accomplish this task."
Attack,those who decide to engage in public nudity might not be representative of 'normal' bodies either.,"naturist communities are filled with people with varying body types, meaning more representative bodies will have increased visibility with public nudity."
Support,"as a member of the jewish court that condemned jesus, joseph of arimathea is unlikely to be a christian invention.",there was strong resentment against the jewish leadership for their role in the condemnation of jesus i thess. 2.15 . it is therefore highly improbable that christians would invent a member of the court that condemned jesus who honors jesus by giving him a proper burial instead of allowing him to be dispatched as a common criminal.

Support,"culture is expressed in a myriad of ways art, dance, architecture which are not dependent on language.",many forms of visual art are considered a type of universal language themselves.
Attack,having more social influence does not mean that men as a whole are superior to women.,it is unlikely that if women were superior to men they would wield less influence within the society they both reside.
Attack,"if sexual orientation were a choice, being subjected to conversion therapy would surely encourage people to choose to be straight.",modern therapy is not yet effective enough to alter sexual orientation. its current level of success does not reflect whether sexual orientation is a choice.
Support,"free markets, unlike regulated markets, generate monopolies.","historically, monopolies have been more common under a free market."

Attack,"when cisgender women go through menopause and lose their ability to menstruate, their gender does not change. thus, reproductive ability does not determine gender identity.","a post menopausal woman's identity is still, to a great extent, founded upon her experiences of her child bearing years despite her current inability to reproduce."
Support,if i have use of weather radar and predict the weather pattern for a particular location and then enter that location and find people who have no internet i can convince them that i am a prophet and tell them that god told me rain would come in a few hours or a day etc. my advanced technology and trickery could easily be thought of or seen as divine providence by them.,the parent proves the point! special providences can be proven false.

Support,god is not necessary for morality. for morality to exist all this is needed is beings like humans that have and exercise preferences.,it is possible that the existence of morality is simply practical to believe in.
Attack,"removing these statues and flags helps hate groups recruit new members. not everyone considers them symbols of slavery, but as expression of a political ideal, and might feel threatened and radicalise if these symbols are removed.",silence in the face of hate groups helps them recruit as well. declining to acquiesce to their requests in our democratic processes is how we make it clear that they are not welcome.
Support,"religion can never really be proven to be true and is ultimately based on belief , which the state of mind in which a person thinks something to be the case with or without there being empirical evidence to prove it.","most religions rely on supernatural causes , which cannot be empirically verified."
Support,passive euthanasia ie withdrawing life support is already commonplace and has not run into any of the predicted cons for active euthanasia taking an action to cause death .,one could argue that the quality of life experienced by those in need of machine assistance to live and those who require harsh and deteriorative medicines are similar and thus both should be allowed to pass on.
Attack,both admiral holdo and rey face struggles that are completely non related to gender.,holdo had to deal with a hot headed male subordinate who displayed a clear lack of trust in her even asserting his plan as superior to the point of detaining her at gunpoint.
Attack,ashraf and galor show that technological advance had no effect on the standard of living between 1 and 1500 ce.,"this study reduces living standards to income per capita, ignoring many other factors in quality of life such as knowledge, life span, and happiness."
Attack,"it's assumed that most people don't actively use logic or think through their arguments anyway, and that their arguments are emotion driven, so therefore countering with logical fallacies is perfectly acceptable.","the assertion that people typically disregard logic entirely, or that emotion is perpetually devoid of logic, is excessively extreme."
Support,"according to utilitarian legal arguments, it is morally right to require all citizens to vote if doing so creates the most good and least harm for everyone.",voting has the potential to generate more utility than other kinds of individual political action because governments with strong support are better equipped to pass laws that benefit large groups of people.
Attack,gender neutral bathrooms could make facilities more accessible to caregivers.,"accessible toilets are typically gender neutral and, as such, pose no issues for carers or those with disabilities. therefore, there is no need for an overhaul of all bathrooms."

Attack,if we look at our close hominid relatives it seems we should share their evolutionary endowment for hypersexuality with minimal attachment.,hypersexuality is considered a mental health disorder . it should not be a considered standard of living simply because primates we share dna with do it.
Attack,there have been numerous complaints from people of color regarding disproportionate censorship of their content on tiktok compared to whitewashed versions of similar content.,"tiktok has issued an apology to black content creators, pledging improved regulation and moderation of content."
Support,excessive power by one person makes arbitrary decisions a risk.,absolute power of a man implies that the sovereign acts by his own decision which can bring about whimsical decision and not by superimposed constitutional rules whose rational procedures exclude whim .
Support,policies should not be judged solely on the basis of a cost benefit analysis.,"if this were the case, many important policies such as social welfare or climate friendly carbon taxes would never have come into existence."
Attack,"if overpopulation were that harmful, lifespans and life conditions for most humans on earth would not have improved greatly over the last few centuries.","from an evolutionary perspective, two centuries is quite a short period of time. there is no way to determine yet whether or not an increased life span is a successful adaptation."
Support,feelings like being hungry or tired serve behavioral and evolutionary purposes for human beings and other biological animals. they would serve little purpose for agi.,"hunger plays a fundamental role in signaling that an animal should eat. since agi would not need to eat, feeling hunger would be unnecessary."
Attack,"some women may opt not to spend the income they would gain were the pay gap to be closed, and instead choose to save or invest. this lack of spending could have deleterious effects on the economy, both nationally and locally.","women spend more money on household upkeep than men, making significant contributions to the national economy as a result."
Attack,"this type of thinking ignores the most basic obligations towards humans aspecially towards the weak and human dignity just reducing them to numbers. this argument is most commonly used to rationalise multiple of questionable deeds like human experimentation, murder and genocide, as it is complexly exemplified in multiple books like this one , and funnily explained in some videos like this one . as a fun fact, it is one of the most common generic motivations for movie and real life villains.",our obligations towards humans are dependent on the state of that human. a foetus does not warrant the same consideration a full grown adult does.
Support,establishing a generic third gender leads to othering of those outside the gender binary.,restricting the number of genders to only three will have a negative impact on the welfare of communities who have diverse experiences of gender.
Support,"corporations in america are too powerful for us to be able to successfully outweigh the harmful influences of corporate tax cuts under supply side economics. tax cuts facilitate increased wealth and power for these corporations to use, e.g. funding activities such as political lobbying.",many fear that the wealth and power of america's largest corporations have created a threat to the democratic structure of the usa.
Attack,sacrifice entails a pain of some form. a painless sacrifice is an oxymoron.,sacrifice simply means to give up something of importance or value for the sake of other considerations. pain is not a necessary part of sacrifice.
Attack,replacing one nonrenewable energy source with another simply prolongs the issue and creates reliance on the new unsustainable technology.,"technically, renewables are not renewable either due to the quantities of rare earth minerals required to provide generation and storage. they are less abundant than common steel or fissile material."

Support,the internet should be regulated insofar as the government should prohibit and combat illegal activity.,it is the duty of the government to protect its people. prohibiting activity online is therefore a necessary priority in the age of the internet.
Attack,"the government often does a poor job at managing serious issues that harm women, like domestic violence and sexual assault. it should, therefore, focus on addressing the most impactful issues, before targeting the gender pay gap.","sexual assault in the workplace can often drive women out of work; tackling this issue and the gender pay gap, thus, go hand in hand."
Support,we evolved to be social. if we want to feel fulfilled we have to build relationships. but relationships are not the meaning of life on their own.,people can find satisfaction with their lives despite having no meaningful relationships.
Attack,colonizing mars brings us one step closer to finding other life in the universe.,this might not be good if we meet them because we could spread negative attributes societal and cultural onto them
Support,the right to privacy is instrumental in protecting autonomy and moral personhood.,invasions of privacy can be harmful to a person's identity and degrade their sense of dignity.
Support,"many countries that have mandatory voting do not enforce it, meaning that they end up with voter turnout rates that are closer to the averages in similar countries.","despite technically having mandatory voting, greece has comparatively low voter turnout rates, hovering around the mid 50 region for the last two parliamentary elections in 2019 and 2015 ."
Attack,philosophy and science are not mutually exclusive.,distinguishing philosophy from natural science can still be meaningful.

Attack,"although extinction is a natural phenomenon, it occurs at a natural background rate of about one to five species per year. scientists estimate we're now losing species at up to 1,000 times the background rate.","human caused extinction above the natural background rate, and extinction due to climate change specifically, are distinct concepts. if, for example, an animal is hunted to extinction like the dodo bird, that wasn't climate change."
Attack,concepts like what acts are good and what are bad are still consistent across various cultures.,the practice of headhunting removing and preserving human heads was widely practiced in different cultures around the world.
Attack,"following this reasoning, it would be better to eat certain disabled humans or babies, than certain animals. from this, it is clear that value should not be dependent on intelligence or brain complexity.","babies have the potential to become much more conscious, mentally complex and intelligent. that likelihood and potential is a key element that needs to be considered."
Attack,religion comforts people from the inevitability of death.,it might be healthier to get over the fear of death and nonexistence all together rather than convince someone it is not the end.
Attack,"the many worlds theory violates occam's razor , which says that the simplest explanation is usually the best one. this is because it requires that an infinite number of parallel universes exist in order to explain this one.","the many worlds are not a postulate of the mwi. they are a consequence of unitary evolution. the branching structure is derived, not assumed."
Support,the capacity of the wagner group to stage another rebellion against the russian regime has been significantly reduced.,"belarusian president lukashenko brokered an agreement between the wagner group and the russian government, essentially ending the current iteration of the wagner group and eliminating it as a threat to putin."
Support,"religion is dogmatic by definition and dogmatic points of view do not allow for analysis and argumentation. it should, therefore, not be compulsory.","it is difficult to critically analyse religions, as religious beliefs are often based on faith, rather than something that is up for discussion."
Attack,jesus fulfilled all prophecies concerning the jewish messiah.,many so called prophetic verses used by new testament authors are not even prophecies about the messiah.
Attack,there are social and environmental factors that contribute to homosexuality.,"most environmental factors aren't choices, but events."
Attack,the united states has often been blamed for the casualties in countries that it has invaded.,the us often operates in murky military environments that make it difficult to define the us as an attacker or invader.
Attack,other mechanisms to reduce inequality would be more effective than a salary cap.,lowering the incomes of executives and capital owners can reduce their political influence by reducing the money they can spend on lobbying or special interest groups.
Support,science also has an preconceived answer the world or physics because it acknowledges that all things are explainable.,"many people hold blind faith in science , despite knowing nothing about the actual science to be able to evaluate the veracity of any set of scientific findings on their merits. assuming science has all the answers is identical in mentality to assuming that everything we can't explain is god."
Support,many approaches to farming plants leads to monocultural agriculture practices that have a harmful impact on the wider environment.,"animal agriculture contributes to an environmentally, socially and financially balanced agricultural system, with mixed feed and food crops, nutritionally diverse diets, reduced inputs and closed nutrient cycles, and a balance of operating risk from diversification."
Attack,"no evidence has been provided that any of the feminist organizations are prone to deceiving others, so even with the claim above, it s best to believe the organization's stated goals.",who stole feminism by christina hoff sommers has 320 pages detailing the deception of feminism.

Attack,family law allows for a regulated exit option in the form of divorce.,"there are socities in which access to divorce is restricted by law , or made otherwise inaccessible due to cultural or religious traditions ."
Attack,eating blood is fundamentally different from accepting it as a tranfusion.,"if an alcoholic who is told by a doctor not to drink alcohol decides instead to inject it, he is still violating the doctor's orders. therefore, blood transfusion is relevantly similar to eating blood."
Attack,"i have experienced a liquid materialising from nothing several feet above my head and dripping, forming knives on the way down. the possibly of this is absurd.","the experience as it stands does make it possible that it occurred. however, there is only one data point the person who experienced it . if the experience was shared by more than one person, then we would have many data points to consider thus making it not only possible this specific event actually occurred, but more plausible than the testimony of one."
Attack,"men have historically played a significant role in industrialization and resource exploitation , contributing to environmental degradation and climate change.",overpopulation is a greater threat to climate change than men.
Attack,society and genetic procreation benefits from stable mating pairs that involve cooperation and care for others. approaching strangers for sex does not facilitate this endeavour.,measures can be taken to ensure that sex does not result in procreation. this can preserve the sanctity of the family unit while still allowing promiscuous behaviour.
Support,"the root for most of our morals are coded in our dna, this is the representation of our evolutionary strategy. in this regard, each species has a different pre neural network structure to guide them in their choices according to their life strategy. this base behavior can be recognised as the root in which our culture morals developed. all this was explained in detail in the book the selfish gene .","repulsion for incest: nobody needs to teach us that incest is bad for us, we feel a natural repulsion in those relatives with whom we grew up this is the trigger, even if they are close relatives or not . gene pools who does not trigger this repulsion has lower chance to survive in case of incest, for a lack of genetic diversity that could bring several weakness on the offspring."
Support,"constantly applying empathy leads interactions to be a zero sum game , where one can run out of the amount of empathy to give to others.","being empathetic can be cognitively and emotionally intense; for example, medical professionals often suffer from compassion fatigue , which can lead to burnout and higher rates of staff turnover."

Attack,"transhumanism provides existential risk reduction and improved quality of life, and is thus an adaptive behaviour.","transhumanism has the ambition to enhance human life on the physical, intellectual and emotional side. while the first two have by any means the potential to improve the quality of life, the latter could have the opposite effect as it denatures a fundamental human quality."
Attack,"this is a claim against factory farming, not eating meat. there are many ways to humanely raise and harvest the animals.",eating meat creates the demand which drives factory farming.
Support,"if jesus was resurrected, we'd expect to find his tomb empty.",jesus's post death appearances support his resurrection.
Attack,"this method is more complicated than approval voting, which makes it spread slower and create more fear among people who don't fully understand its implications for them and how much it will cost to use repeal.",this method has found far greater support among voting theorists than approval voting.
Attack,the effects of global warming directly threaten the land and environment that humans need to live in.,"given that many people already survive in extreme temperatures , a few more degrees of extreme temperature are unlikely to threaten extinction."
Support,the existence of controversy or debate on an issue does not mean there is no absolute truth.,"in the flat earth vs. round earth controversy, the round earth side is objectively true."
Support,"legal powers are not bestowed based on their anticipated impact on public trust in institutions. therefore, public trust should not determine the validity of pardons.","each government official holds specific powers, which are necessary to perform their duties. revoking every power that could potentially be misused would significantly limit their ability to effectively serve their purpose."
Attack,most non capitalist economic systems coerce people into things they don't want.,most of market participants are coerced by advertising examples

Attack,"minds are abstract objects also but complex ones , therefore there is only one kind of thing that could fall under such a description. but non minds are the simpler abstract objects, thus preferred as explanations under occam's razor.",the parent assumes substance dualism to be false and thus makes an unwarranted assumption.
Support,"gun control legislation represents an infringement on the right to keep and bear arms, which is expressly forbidden by the second amendment.",the definition of arms used in the constitution applies equally to modern firearms.
Support,lived experience and observation suggest that we have free will.,the universal human experience of having our will frustrated or compromised is a sound basis for considering free will a legitimate phenomenon.
Support,the intent of bringing up crime rates in black communities is rarely to try to address the inequalities leading to them and more often to dilute and minimize black communities' problems and support racist talking points.,this rarely goes hand in hand with a full understanding of the sociopolitical context or a critical assessment of the origin and accuracy of the data.

Attack,"in the absence of a level playing field, gender blindness can lead to a failure to provide accommodations for gender specific needs and challenges.","gender linked advantages and disadvantages would last for only a few generations, until those born in a gendered society have all died. subsequently, the playing field will be more or less level."

Attack,famous animals such as tigers and elephants draw visitors to the zoo. the revenue made from these visitors can be invested in preserving animals that are less popular attractions as has been the case with frogs .,"some animals are more 'popular' than others because they are bigger, nonexistent in a given country, more difficult to see in the wild or just better known to the general population."
Attack,"while true, it is still moral because profitability and the free market system are connected to morality, and the reason for that is the free market calls for voluntary action between individuals for someone to compete in the market place, they must hire the best people possible, regardless of the colour of their skin, sexual orientation or religious beliefs.","while it is true that capitalists wish to hire the most productive workers, they also want to do so for as low a cost as possible."

Support,"monotheism does not preclude the existence of evil, insofar as some of the features of the traditional conception of god can be abandoned without rejecting the traditional conception of god in toto in its entirety .","if such a powerful being exists, then the idea that he even cares what we do to each other is a massive assumption, and may not be true. in which case, a god may exist, but they may not be the same one as traditionally conceived."

Attack,"suicide is a cry for help. the cdc says less than 5 percent of suicide attempts are fatal and that 90 percent of those who attempt suicide will die by other means , suggesting that intervention results in many saved lives who never attempt suicide again.","suicide, in cases of terminal illness, is not a cause that can be intervened in any useful way. this is often refereed to as medical aid in dying , and aims to reduce the suffering of those who have terminal illnesses."

Attack,public opinion in the us supports this step: more americans support an independent palestinian state than oppose it.,two thirds of americans sympathize more with israel than with palestine; only 15 think the other way around. this makes the recognition of palestine against israel's explicit preference hard to sell.
Support,any major industry heavily contributes to climate change. this is not particular to meat production.,"mass production of almost anything negatively impacts the environment. if the public were to demand more fresh meat and food without all the chemicals on the plants and in the animals we would go back to smaller family owned farms and ranches, which would all but eliminate harm to the environment."
Attack,"studies suspect the wuhan huanan seafood wholesale market, where live animals are traded, to be the origin of the corona virus .",the wuhan huanan seafood wholesale market could be an origin of the virus even if the virus is partly engineered or escaped due to a lab leak. the escaped virus could have first infected animals and only later infected humans or the escaped virus could have first spread there after a chain of transmissions.
Attack,that the bible didn't distinguish and classify these different animals properly illustrates that the bible is not advocating evolution as the origin of species.,the bible isn't advocating anything. it is telling a story with a remarkable similarity to actual events predating human observers.
Support,the memorials were intended specifically to communicate support for racism rather than to commemorate civil war events or individuals per se.,"most confederate monuments are not particularly old and have likely been put up with the intent to demonstrate dominance over african americans during two different time periods: the jim crow era 1900 1918 and the civil rights movement era 1954 1968 splc, p. 12 ."

Attack,"there is an overwhelming consensus in the scientific community supporting anthropogenic climate change, and rejecting anti vaccine movement arguments. the belief that there is an ongoing debate among scientists speaks of politics twisting scientific knowledge, and not of science being inherently biased by politics.","there is an on going debate amongst scientists, it's just heavily weighted in one direction."
Support,"recognition may improve palestinian perceptions of the us, but it will alienate israel a us ally.",a deterioration in israel us relations will jeopardize america's operations and presence in the region.

Support,there is no known condition for a western victory in afghanistan.,even ending the taliban's control of territory would not guarantee a safer afghanistan.
Support,pope francis has focused too much on social and political issues.,pope francis has spoken out on issues beyond the purview of the papacy.

Support,it is a country's right as a sovereign nation to self govern and thus decide against helping those who are not its citizens or residents.,many democratic countries have made formal commitments in their constitutions to defend their borders and serve the interests of their own citizens before the wellbeing of non citizens.
Attack,"president trump was referring to illegal immigration, which is by definition a criminal activity.","even if the statement referred to the crime of illegally entering the country, this does not explain the references to drugs and rape."
Attack,this amounts to cultural appropriation that is disrespectful to mexican people.,"if mexicans and mexican americans found cinco de mayo disrespectful, they would not go out of their way to promote their mexican businesses on the holiday."
Attack,"sex differences in the location of the urethral orifice explain gendered clothing: women need to only lift their skirts to urinate, whereas men need to unzip their pants to be able to urinate.","tunics , worn by both men and women in ancient china, would allow both people with either urethral orifices to urinate with ease."
Support,"violence will not solve the underlying reasons behind people attacking others, particularly members of the lgbt community.","in order to tackle these beliefs, societal beliefs need to be reformed so that people become more tolerant."
Support,christianity is a complete and well established system of belief.,christian belief is internally consistent and supported by biblical scripture.
Support,"leadership roles, such as executive offices, require skills or characteristics that cannot be easily found or substituted.","effective ceos possess visionary creativity and are skilled at anticipating and predicting market trends, as well as identifying innovative strategies before they become evident."
Attack,defining evil as that which causes unnecessary harm has a long tradition.,there are some forms of evil which seem to have nothing to do with harm. this implies that evil cannot be understood through harm.
Support,the suggestion that god cannot find a way to let us develop virtue without evil contradicts the idea that god is all powerful.,"it should be possible for an all powerful god to create a universe full of maximally good and virtuous people, who just happen to never exercise their virtues because there is no evil."
Attack,famous paintings can provide enjoyment through their digital copies. so a famous painting burning is not as irreplaceable as a cat you can not bring to life again.,"seeing a real painting or a digital version of it is a very different pair of shoes the colors, format, and texture can vary significantly."
Support,occupied territories are territories captured in war from an established and recognized sovereign nation. israeli presence in the west bank does not meet this criterion.,"none of the armistice agreements after the 1948 war created political borders; this task was supposed to be taken care of by later negotiations. as such, the current borders are illegitimate."
Attack,"even without public information about income, many people already know that income inequality plays a role in labor conditions. however, this has not necessarily led to changes in business practices.","a particular practice such as pay transparency does not need to necessarily lead to a particular outcome, such as the reduction of inequality. if it promotes this outcome regularly, that is reason enough to adopt it."
Attack,"but it does suffer from the teaming effect, where cloning a candidate can only help them.",there are rules for the third semifinalist that prevent this problem.
Support,"in many cases where feminists identify sexism, it is often very difficult for anyone unaccustomed to perceiving these issues to notice.","even though it may not be as obvious, covert sexism holds women back, and is as damaging as more overt forms. as these actions are innocuous, critiquing them can feel like an outsized response."
Support,"there are many reasons why a pregnant person may not be equipped to or want to raise a child. in these cases, it is important that they are able to have an abortion.","some people may not have the financial resources to go through a pregnancy, as it is very expensive and time consuming."
Support,the presidential power to pardon is essentially neutral. the moral implications of the power are determined by how it is used.,"pardoning certain categories of individuals could have a positive impact on the justice system by clearing administrative backlog, reducing overcrowding in prisons, and quickening the delivery of justice in more serious cases."
Support,the covid 19 virus mutated much slower than the seasonal flu.,covid 19's lower mutation rate was the result of the presence of basic proofreading machinery that helped prevent errors from being integrated.

Attack,coding skills are highly sought after in the modern job market.,professions and skills that are most in demand today may not be the same as those in demand tomorrow.
Attack,"some religions practice beheadings, honor killings, and dogmatic responses to sin that are an overall negative for societies.","if societies are an extension of man, and man an extension of god, then for man to dishonor god is necessarily a dishonor to society. it is sin that makes society reprehensible, not the practice of some religion."
Support,our social behavior will be an integral part of the agi s development and initial training data . providing agi with data that exhibits a fundamental respect for them and encourages social behavior will likely be better for most agi and humans.,"algorithmic bias , the coding of our prejudices into ai, is pervasive in current machine learning. to correct this bias, it will be necessary to develop data sets that model an unbiased, respectful view of the world."
Attack,the military is likely to be more appealing to people if it is open to them. equal conscription would encourage people to think of the military as a fair domain instead of a male dominated one.,"the military should not lower its standards and accept anyone, as many americans are ineligible for military service due to health issues or past criminal convictions. these exclusion criteria are necessary to ensure safety within the military."
Support,"many people have claimed that there are or have been programs to study exotic origin non human technology, including vehicles. these include bob lazar, david grusch , jake barber, jay stratton , james t. lacatski, michael herrera, and many others. grusch filed a whistleblower complaint to the intelligence community inspector general icig and his claims were described as credible and urgent by the icig in 2022.",army sergeant clifford stone claimed flying vehicles of non human origin have been retrieved.

Support,"farmers require fewer herbicides to grow genetically modified crops, which lowers costs of food production.","monsanto s 'roundup ready' corn and soy contain a gene which makes plants immune to 'roundup' , a potent broad spectrum herbicide that kills nearly all other exposed flora. this means that farmers need only use this one herbicide for all such crops."
Attack,"the combined weight of three things that carry no weight is nothing. there is no credible source willing to lend their name to the rumours, yet plenty of respectable people who have said on the record that they do not recognise the anonymous descriptions.","many of the key people rejecting the story would lose power by publicly accepting it, which is a possible motivation to lie."
Support,"promoting attacks against certain groups is incitement to violence, not hate speech. these cases do not depend on having hate speech legislation.",most countries already have laws against the incitement of violence which effectively punish and deter such acts.

Attack,"delaying climate change mitigation and combat ing food and water scarcity are not related, so that point is irrelevant in this branch.","in this context with the specific example of combat ing food and water scarcity per parent claim , the source suggests that the belief that such innovation technology based measures to mitigate negative impacts of climate change facilitates the belief that climate change mitigation is not all that important since such tech will save us from the harm, thereby delaying sufficient climate change mitigation."
Support,only micro evolution has been observed. macro evolution has never been observed.,"darwin's finches only demonstrate micro evolution, minor variations within an existing species."
Support,"if private schools were banned, children at state schools would no longer be put at a disadvantage by the quality and style of teaching they receive.","without private schools, the best and brightest students can be distributed geographically through state schools, instead of coagulating in private boarding schools ."
Support,helping ex convicts get jobs will unlock a hitherto underutilised workforce.,ex convicts are more likely to devote themselves to their jobs when they feel valued.

Attack,banning people from protesting at abortion clinics represents a violation of their right to free speech.,"this is not a legitimate form of discussion, because it's intent is to coerce women out of abortions. this is evidenced by the tactics used by protesters, which is not that of a calm discussion but instead involves harassment and shouting."
Attack,"as children become more self sufficient from life skills education, their parents may withdraw care, such as cooking family meals.","60 of parents claim that their children are not prepared to take on further responsibilities due to being immature and not knowing enough, both of which life skills education can combat."
Attack,there is a deep cultural bias towards hiring men over women.,"if the cultural bias is really as strong as this suggests, quotas will succeed in getting women into managerial positions but likely have little impact in terms of ensuring those women are respected and have real authority."
Attack,autocratic regimes like putin's are hardly stable.,putin has maintained his position of power for a total of 16 years without significant difficulties.
Support,capitalism is an unstable system which often results in crises.,"on a personal level, capitalism creates fears among people and worsens their mental health."
Support,uap demonstrate flight characteristics and technological capabilities that are many iterations generations ahead of the best respective technologies humans have. they are also beyond the trajectory of any current aviation technology approach and seemingly defy known physics.,"in regards to defying known physics, if no advanced illusion technologies are used, aliens may have developed a deep understanding of the fabric of reality and found ways to manipulate it e.g. the simulation or the holographic universe to hack around known limitations of physics."
Support,some studies suggest that vegetarians are less healthy and have a lower quality of life than meat eaters.,"if the vegetables fruits are not organic, one can be exposed to a dangerous quantity of pesticides."

Support,germany's unification totaled around usd 2 trillion over two decades. this gives us a base from which to estimate korean unification costs.,"east germany was far more developed at the time of unification than nk currently is. as a result, can estimate with some confidence that korean unification will likely be more expensive than 2 trillion over 20 years."
Attack,we wouldn't have to deal with the death of our loved ones.,"without having to deal with the death of loved ones, we would become less sympathetic and out of touch."
Attack,coding is increasingly becoming an essential skill for work and life.,"coding is becoming more popular as a career in the 21st century, but it isn't a life skill or an everyday skill that could be very useful outside of that career path. other skills that vary from different careers should explored in other to encourage students to pursue any career."
Attack,"for most countries, it would be too expensive to build more affordable housing or provide more generous social programs.",investments in social care are long term investments that would be easy to pay back in the future.
Support,teaching children to use gender neutral language on a daily basis will help fight gender stereotyping .,"research shows that, if language refers to one gender e.g., just men , people are unlikely to interpret it to apply to all genders equally."
Attack,"if people are using social media for news, there must be editorial standards .","the burden to create and enforce editorial standards should be on the institutions and officials who write content, not on internet platforms."
Attack,"the 2nd law of thermodynamics states that all things fall toward decay in a closed system, unless an outside force acts within the system. in our universe, the outside force would be god.","science advises that 2nd law thermodynamics may not apply to systems in which the gravitational force is important and the general theory of relativity is required, such as the universe in a large scale. this could also lend itself towards big crunch theory of the universe, which is still possible."
Attack,"as carl schmitt says, all significant concepts of the modern theory of the state are secularized theological concepts... schmitt, 2005","science is not a 'theory of the state' . theories of state come in the domain of sociology, and even though one may have debates about sociology as a science, sociology is not all of science. science involves the rigorous practice of the scientific method ."
Support,"matthew 19:23 24 also luke 18:24 25 says that a rich person cannot enter heaven on their own, but they can with the grace of god.","after his disciples respond to jesus's parable by asking how anyone can possibly be saved, jesus responds, with man this is impossible, but with god all things are possible matthew 19:26 ."
Support,"in so far as every conceivable instrument of perception and scientific methodology converges on a truth, we may declare it more objective, it's a spectrum not binary.",the bayes theorem is a proven mathematical tool for approximating objectivity closer and closer with only uncertain data for a start.
Support,pope francis is making the catholic church about original christian values again.,"pope francis declared that church officials need to incorporate the values of humanity, humility, and acceptance into their teachings and lives."
Attack,many people enjoy the sense of control that comes from driving a geared transmission.,gears are a compromise to enable an engine to provide an appropriate level of torque at different speeds. there is far more control in an ev where there is instant torque at all speeds.
Support,humans are more prone to cruelty than animals. the contribution to the quality of life as a whole by a species should be taken into consideration over the value of the species.,"since humans have a greater ability to control their own environment and that of other animals, it is statistically more likely that humans have committed more acts of cruelty than other animals."
Attack,"the right to liberty, also defined as freedom from, is inalienable as we were absolutely free in a pre political state of nature.",there is no inalienable right to liberty. all liberty has been won by hard struggle and is retained by continuing legal and civil struggle against oppression.

Support,"if everyone on the planet were to switch to a vegetarian diet , the present arable land on earth could support up to 10 billion people.","if every american were to stop eating meat and the farmland was repurposed to grow crops for human consumption instead of animal feed, the resulting food stocks would sustain more than double the number of people."
Support,an effective implementation of liquid democracy requires high voter involvement.,"to achieve high voter turn out, a government or society would need to develop a sense of public duty and pride in voting within the electorate."
Attack,basic hygienic rules have been written as religious texts to enforce them as higher truths. this reduced illness and death.,"some religious practices, although seemingly hygienic burying feces in the ground and having a bath after a trip to the latrine , were actually a way to spread parasites and increase disease."
Attack,cognitive ability and consciousness do not signify importance or superiority over others. disabled people have as much right to live a life free of suffering as able bodied people.,it can be more ethical to save a young non disabled person instead of an old disabled person since more dalys would be saved. the debate is not about right s but about values.
Attack,"many of the monuments do not date from the appropriate historical period civil war and thus have a political, rather than historical meaning.","while some statues were from a later period this argument does not apply to all statues being considered for removal splc, p. 12 ."
Support,animal transport associated with zoos may transfer pathogens between different areas exposing animals or local human populations to diseases they do not have the immunity to combat.,a 2004 review identified around 25 human infectious disease outbreaks from 1990 to 2000 associated with visitors to animal exhibits .

Support,there have been several disasters during which social media provided the only viable venue for communication.,"during superstorm sandy, most people didn t have power, but some cell networks and wifi towers were still operational. many people used facebook to detail the destruction and reassure friends or family that they were safe."
Attack,"just when it appears all is lost for the noble hero, the seemingly invincible dark lord is betrayed and murdered by his apprentice, a death that was telegraphed beforehand.","while the death of snoke may have been predictable in the regard that it follows a familiar framework, it was very unexpected that it happened already in the 2nd movie of the trilogy, rather than at the end."
Support,many successful capitalists are also extraordinary philanthropists.,bill and melinda gates spend billions to improve the lives of the disadvantaged.
Support,the state has a moral obligation to fight poverty.,"the state has a moral obligation to provide for the basic needs of its citizens. perhaps the welfare state could be reformed and curtailed to more specifically fit this purpose, instead of abolished."
Support,"consent for new individuals to be born is implicit in any society, as new individuals are required for the society's continued existence.","society has also never consented to not having children and to all the burdens this implies, for example for a country's health care and pensions system long term."
Support,"as luke was careful to give a well researched account , and was a known associates of at least one primary witness, pau l, it would be reasonable that his research included other primary sources like peter, john, james, mary magdalene, martha, mary the mother of jesus.","after his resurrection, jesus ate fish in front of his disciples, confirming that he had a physical body."
Attack,pornography can facilitate the exploration of one's sexuality and preferences.,"because porn is often exaggerated or outright fake , the exploration that it offers might be impractical in real life and therefore useless at best and harmful at worst."
Support,"when also considering other data accumulated so far such as reports of alien abductions and incidents like the ariel school ufo incident and statements or investigations by relevant officials , the extraterrestrial origin beings explanation seems to be most in agreement with occam's razor , which is an important established principle of science.",cattle mutilations have occurred over many decades and so far the cause has not been identified while the case for aliens being behind it becomes ever stronger even when that sounds absurd and bizarre.
Support,trans women have been accused of seeking to regulate the language used by cis women when speaking about gender issues. the expanded use of gender neutral language may work against the interests of cis women by obscuring sex based inequality.,there are a number of experiences particular to cis women that are not shared by trans women. changing the definition of the term woman in a way that does not include female obscures this distinction.
Support,the order in which things are created in genesis 1 is wrong.,"genesis 1:3 4 claims that light was created on the first day, but the sun isn't created until the fourth day."
Support,"despite impressive advancements, current ai systems are still limited.",they are always narrow ais such as plausible texts from prompts or playing chess and at most can be combined with other ais to enable a wider range tasks through one ui.
Attack,"religion discourages rape, which contributes to creating a safer society for women.",religions feed rape culture by encouraging women to dress modestly to avoid the being sexually assaulted.
Attack,objective moral judgments can be made so long as parties agree on a criterion for morality. a subjective moral standard still allows for actions to be objectively judged as moral or not.,objective by definition must not include opinion or feelings in the definition. whereas morality is a completely subjective definition of peoples opinion and feelings. so an agreed upon moral judgment would be by definition be subjective not objective
Attack,there is no factual conflict between biblical creation stories and science. the bible provides many passages that allow for evolution without conflict with a creator.,"the bible explains the creation of whole animal kingdoms as taking place on individual days of a week, which conflicts with evolution."
Attack,jainism rejects the concept of god as contradictory and lacking evidence.,"despite eschewing belief in an omnipotent creator god, jains venerate jinas enlightened immaterial beings who also lack empirical support."
Support,"there are claims that scientific evidence exists that point to non human intelligence, most likely extraterrestrial origin beings, and are available to the public.","multiple contactees or people who alleged they were subject to alien abductions have been investigated by doctors, scientists, reporters, or ufologists and presented some evidence that have been made partially public. examples include the dress worn by betty hill and an implant by terry lovelace ."
Support,developing countries often need to use protectionism within some industries in order to develop them before opening them up to international markets. a global state with absolutely free trade would not allow this staggered development.,brazil developed many of its industries by pursuing strict protectionist policies and continues to do so today.
Support,an idea may be exaggerated even for good reasons yet that does not conclusively prove that the idea is a falsehood or myth.,exaggerations regarding overpopulation aim to make people aware of their negative impact on future generations.
Support,gender quotas are ineffective and counterproductive.,gender quotas cannot guarantee that women on boards and in managerial positions are taken seriously or considered for ceo or chairman roles in the long term.
Support,"although on a biological continuum with other animals, it is humans' unique constellation of features embodied form, idealizing imagination, cumulative culture and tools, language, advanced cognition, etc that set them distinctly apart from other animals.",the ability to conceptualise specific ideas and thoughts about another being's existence is a form of consciousness only humans have.
Attack,"considering something better than something else is inherently subjective and can't, therefore, be applied universally.",this completely negates the ever important objective point of view.
Attack,"despite the title, this is not an argument for god's existence, just for intelligent design, thus it does not support the thesis god exists .","it is true the argument doesn t provide direct evidence for the proposition, god exists. however, since it is evidence for a designer of the cosmos, it provides corroborative evidence for the thesis, god exists."
Support,cinco de mayo raises awareness about mexican culture in the us.,americans are able to experience mexican food and culture they may not otherwise come in contact with.
Attack,extensive international air travel restrictions can significantly delay pandemics.,travel restrictions delay the spread of infections by only a few weeks.
Attack,transgender women have an advantage over biological women because they have the bodies of biological men.,"transgender females people do not receive the benefits from a male genotype if they did not undergo male puberty . thus, transgender females who did not undergo puberty should be allowed to compete with women, while those who did undergo male puberty should have to compete with men."
Attack,"oftentimes, alt right groups unfairly represent feminists to radicalise young men; the actions or ideologies of various feminist waves have little impact on this depiction.","feminist women who do not always live by their values can alienate men who feel that feminism is merely for social gain, and not for improving the world."
Support,mathematical facts and objects do not exist objectively they are merely useful constructs.,mathematical concepts do not have an independent existence apart from human consciousness.
Support,"by making it harder for less privileged people to become politicians, privately funded elections undermine the equality of opportunity for citizens to run for office.",public financing of election campaigns makes it easier for women to run for election.
Attack,"public spaces are typically not gender segregated, yet they are rife with hostility toward those lying outside the binary. the same is likely to be true for gender neutral public bathrooms.","while harassment of transgender people may not halt entirely in gender neutral bathrooms, it is likely that harassment justified on the basis that someone is using the incorrect bathroom would cease."
Support,"pc culture stifles the marketplace of ideas , wherein all ideas are welcome in public discourse, but the bad ones are weeded out, and only the best, most beneficial ideas become broadly accepted.","pc culture on some campuses in the us and uk have a tendency to censor , rather than addressing views they disagree with . the truths of progressive viewpoints are seen as unquestionably true and license to demonize anyone who doesn't conform."
Attack,temperature checks are employed at airports to detect people who may be infected by covid 19.,temperature checks may give people a false sense of security about the safety of air travel.
Attack,"similarly to domesticated animals, zoo animals have safer, higher quality lives compared to their counterparts left to fight for their survival in the wild.",forcibly removing humans from their natural environment and placing them in 'a superior environment' would be unacceptable.
Attack,most of the mathematical world is not applicable to the natural world.,recognizing that most of the mathematical world is not applicable to the natural world does not provide an explanation why parts of mathematics do apply to reality e.g. those areas chiefly studied by physics .
Support,"transgender women benefit from the higher testosterone levels present in their traditionally male hormonal systems. even with synthetic hormone treatments, research suggests these women retain an advantage over their cisgender female peers.",studies have found that the higher testosterone levels of transgender women athletes poses an intolerable unfairness .
Attack,"the coolness of something as a weapon includes how cool it makes the wielder. wielding a terminator means giving it orders, sending it off, and waiting somewhere safe, which is uncool.","sometimes, having something do your work for you can be the greater option."
Attack,"war brings disastrous effects to the countries involved, including the mass destruction of cities and long lasting effects in the economy.","in the past, wars that were very short don't necessarily lead to the stabilization of the region or the country itself iraq war and don't guarantee that civilians will not suffer battle of france ."
Attack,subjective public perception doesn't alter the very real fact that democracy is just as old fashioned and outmoded as monarchy is.,"research generally supports that democratic principles are correlated with political stability, human rights and the necessary conditions for a prosperous economy ."
Attack,so many people are worried about animals but don't even think twice when walking by a homeless person on the streets. it's preposterous. how about we worry about our own kind first and then start talking about animals.,this implies that caring for animals or caring for people is a binary choice. it isn't. there are those who are well placed and willing to care for people and those who prefer to serve the animal kingdom. as a species we don't just have one idea at a time and follow that to conclusion before we pursue another. it benefits all if humans divide their attentions between various issues and problems we face.
Attack,jesus thought they were performing both miracles dynameis and lawlessness anomian .,this reading is poorly supported from the context.
Attack,the content of the message and where and when it was said do not match that of matthew 28:16 20.,"they both contain the same essential idea being sent out to the world as witnesses , and even though matthew 28 has more details they don't clearly contradict."
Attack,that not one religion is entirely free of some errors in consistency does not conclude that a god does not exist or that he is not pleased with at least some people based on how they worship.,that not one religion is entirely free of errors speaks to the idea that god is not what he is proposed to be in regards to perfection omnipotence or omniscience .
Support,religious belief is often influenced by a variety of external and internal factors that are outside of the individual's control. it therefore makes little sense to describe faith as a selfish act.,"the faith of many religious individuals was constructed by the background in which they grew up and influenced by their parents and communities, just as many other aspects of their personality were."
Support,the absence of economic competition for planned parenthood means that it is unlikely to strive for the provision of best economic outcomes.,many of planned parenthood's competitors in general health services are explicitly anti abortion .
Support,a space elevator will make the colonisation of other planets much easier.,a space elevator would deconstruct the psychological discontinuity between earth and 'outer space'. this will be essential to the normalization of interplanetary colonization.
Attack,"computer science should be the first to fall, because programmers know their job better than any other job and thus know how to tell a computer to do it more than other jobs especially ones far removed, like warehousing .",some things are more amenable to being replaced by ai than others. there is no reason to think computer programming is easier to train an ai to do than something else like driving or radiology.
Support,"younger generations are moving away from conformity to gender roles and stereotypes, which will likely lead to a societal re consideration of how these roles are defined.","younger generations are moving towards a gender neutral approach to parenting, which will shape the way future generations are taught to conceive of gender."
Support,the catholic church is inherently problematic. it is unrealistic to expect a truly progressive individual to head such an organisation.,the church's hierarchy is prone to corruption and abuse.
Attack,there is no apparent contradiction in a concept of a world without evil.,"there may be implicit contradictions, which only an omniscient being could perceive."
Attack,hate crimes are less fair than other crimes because they attack people for things they can't change.,attacking people for making the world more fair e.g. investigative journalists has more of an effect on equality.
Support,having many husbands reduces the workload women face and thus enhances their quality of life.,"in a couple household women tend to be overly burdened by sharing responsibilities, such as cleaning the house, which leads them to have a higher workload and thus an unhappier life."
Support,many philosophical works by women are incredibly influential and have dictated the course of modern thought.,philippa foot created the famous trolley problem thought experiment.
Attack,"men and women are equally able to stay home and raise children, demonstrating more fluid gender roles and a decreased need for feminist influence.","society looks down on women who are not married with children by the age of 30, whereas men are often able to wait and marry at an older age."
Attack,the right to personal autonomy is restricted in cases where individuals may knowingly or unknowingly harm themselves.,"the state cannot force someone to act in their best interests. just as the state cannot force someone to exercise, the state ought not to restrict anabolic steroid use."
Support,"capitalism encourages the economy to produce things people want, rather than what the government wants.","since capitalism allows regular people to own capital, the economy is incentivized to align itself with the interests of regular people."
Attack,"some speech can cause psychological harm to people who did not ask to be subjected to it, and should therefore be restricted by law.",the potential for speech to cause psychological harm alone is not sufficient justification for its prohibition.
Support,putin's attack on ukraine is in violation of international agreements.,the un general assembly resolution states that russian aggression against ukraine violates the charter of the united nations .
Support,following islam has positive benefits for the individual.,islam promotes self awareness and continuous self improvement .
Attack,"by destroying the iconography memorializing history, we forget history. those ideologies, if even they were wrong, are doomed to repeat.",the purpose of these statues was not simply to represent an ideology but also to act as a reminder to black people that they are inferior and to support the lost cause narrative.
Support,kids and teenagers are missing out on important social cues because of overuse of digitized social interactions over social media.,social media is affecting our ability to read each others body language which in turn affects our human relationships.
Support,shows like shark tank can stimulate innovation by inspiring viewers into developing new technologies.,kids watching shark tank may be inspired to open a business of their own.
Support,people are more motivated to work and compete harder if they know the next level up offers a big salary jump.,research indicates that 48 of appointments of managerial positions result from reorganization within a company. this demonstrates that a degree of mobility does exist with in companies p. 7 .
Attack,"while much meat farming is cruel, it does not have to be. ethical consumers could choose only to buy from ethical sources i.e. free range farming that afford animals the same if not better quality of life than they would have had in the wild, and a painless death.",animals cannot possibly enjoy the same quality of life that they'd have had in the wild if they were bred and raised with the sole purpose of being eaten.
Attack,"when somebody is born, they possess the capacity to consent to existence by choosing to remain alive. if an agent truly no longer consented to existence, they could choose to end their life.",the fact that they have the option to end their life does not mitigate the harm caused by bringing them into the world without their consent.
Support,"one statement is not simpler or more obvious than the other. one cannot appeal to occam's razor to prove a point, only to suggest a hypothesis.","occam's razor isn't always correct. sometimes, more complicated reasons are the correct ones."
Attack,"there are other very successful democracies which carry out the death penalty, such as japan and singapore .",singapore has been considered an authoritarian state from its inception.
Support,the air in cities is less breathable due to emissions from cars.,new delhi has often had to close down urban schools because of pollution.
Attack,"vampires such as the cullens in the twilight saga and the salvatores in the vampire diaries display compassion towards human beings and a strong desire not to cause harm to them, thus suggesting that not all vampires are inherently evil.","in these works of fiction, while the stated families are often kind, they are represented as a minority within a largely evil vampire community."
Attack,a cis woman who is unable to bear children would not be excluded from a women only space based on that criterion alone.,a support space for young mothers would be unlikely to accept a woman without children.
Support,the bible was written by humans who are naturally error prone.,the propensity for error is considered to be inherently biologic as it is intrinsic to human behavio r.
Attack,"murray himself is agnostic about the parts of his research people find controversial and is careful, even in his book, to caution people about making any connections between his work and individuals.",murray's equivocations about his own work reflect a motte and bailey tactic that further proves the point of the great grandparent claim that he was deplatformed for acting in bad faith rather than for his research.
Attack,"irrespective of the field of study, college students learn to deal intensely with complex subject matters and develop a structured working method. this skill set is important for politicians.",it is unclear whether these sorts of abstract skillsets are actually substantially beneficial in terms of making judgement about concrete economic and social questions.
Support,monarchs' support of issues overlooked by the government can help these causes reach the national agenda.,royal patronage of an organisation can lead to a growth in public support and fund raising.
Support,"relying solely on plant based food would burden the resources used for plant cultivation, which are distinct from those used for raising animals.",large land areas are not fit for growing crops but excellent for raising livestock . thus a combination of plant and animal food should be the ideal way to feed the world.
Support,the jewish scriptures do not specifically mention a messiah figure coming.,"the only times the word is used in the hebrew is a. in spots where the torah adds that title to certain levitical priestly positions, b. when david, as king of israel, refers to his predecessor saul or his sons, and c. in lamentations, referring to the breath of our nostrils, adonai's messiah who came and was killed by the babylonians. none of these specifically mention a messiah figure."
Support,"if god is maximally great, we run into the problem of non god objects .","p3: i exist. i do not think i am god. if i were god, i would know. therefore i am not god. therefore, at least one non god object exists."
Support,"hamas' military actions consistently endanger civilian populations , in a manner that is consistent with legal definitions of terrorism. it is crucial for the us to persist in combating such acts of terrorism as a moral imperative.",hamas' actions in palestine harm the safety and well being of the palestinians it claims to represent. the u.s. should combat hamas to safeguard these individuals.
Attack,the biological distinctions between men and women are not sufficient to override the desires of the individual.,"that is a red herring . this discussion is about how to create rules for athletes. this is not overriding the desires of individuals, but deciding whether the desires of one individual are sufficient to override fairness for a whole group."
Attack,"morality is not an objective standard. some parents exercise their vision of morality in different ways. teaching religion, civics or fashion are all ways in which parents pass on their values before children are old enough to learn on their own.",there is a fundamental difference between teaching a child something and surgically altering them.
Attack,the modern existence of a standing military rather than reliance on a citizen militia makes private gun ownership more essential as a check on government power .,"given the capacity, scale, and technology of the us military , civilian militias are incapable of checking the government's power."
Support,"most jurisdictions have legislation restricting gratuitous cruelty to animals, suggesting a broader acceptance that animals have some fundamental rights.","even the sharpest critics of animal rights support the anticruelty laws and the simple moral judgment behind these laws is that animal suffering matters, and that this judgment supports a significant amount of reform. therefore animals have rights."
Support,the scientific method depends on a notion of causality that depends on a deterministic universe.,"based on what is known in physics, nothing exists without an accompanying cause ."
Attack,open source software could have intentional vulnerabilities in the code.,"if a serious vulnerability existed, it would be noticed faster in an open source project."
Support,it cherry picks data because ultimately the same church lifted its ban on his material.,"galileo was also a christian himself, part of the same church. so the conflict is an internal one not an external one. such that it was church vs church, not science vs church."
Support,"if we truly hold life to be valuable, then it holds that we all have an obligation to strive to work through our problems and build a better life.","only in choosing to continue living, can we appreciate the value of living."

Support,there have been thousands of instances of child sexual abuse in single sex schools run by the catholic church.,thousands of boys were reportedly raped by faculty members in catholic schools in ireland.
Attack,"the current trajectory shows that technology will never be able to reduce costs enough to be viable, as costs right now greatly outweigh profits.","never is a long time, people used to say humans would never fly. so there's a possibility that costs can be reduced enough to make vertical farming work."
Support,several western leaders made assurances about nato expansionalism moving not one inch eastward .,the german publication der spiegel researched the question whether there is evidence for russia's claim about western promises and found there to be ample reason for russians to believe nato wouldn't expand eastward.
Support,"abolishing inheritance would disincentivize the creation of wealth, as any wealth they create will be confiscated rather than being passed down.","the state should encourage the development of long term wealth for oneself, and posterity."
Support,leviticus 11:13 19 states that bats are birds. bats are quite obviously mammals.,"deuteronomy 14:18 places bats within the same group as storks, herons, and owls. it places no other mammal in this group."
Support,providers motivated by profits sometimes focus less on patient safety .,"priory healthcare, a private health care provider, was fined 300,000 after pleading guilty to criminal charges related to the death of amy el keria."
Attack,it is important to leave confederate memorials and monuments up to teach our own painful history.,"statues aren't a way to remember history, they're a collective decision about who to honor and what our values are as a society. the disproportionate reverence placed on confederate figures demonstrates a fondness for, if not an explicit endorsement of, white supremacy."
Attack,the use of politically correct language allows for the inclusion of marginalized groups that are frequently excluded from discourse due to the use of exclusionary language.,"language alone cannot address societal injustices and may alienate those unfamiliar with the terminology, leading to disengagement from important discussions."
Attack,a wide range of hugely succesful companies have paid 0 in federal income tax.,"in 2019 , amazon paid 162 million in federal income taxes."
Attack,it is unlikely that native american headresses worn for concerts are intended to show their traditional meaning . this means there is little difference for the appropriator between the headress and other aesthetic adornments.,people are likely to interpret symbols within their context ; there is no reason to believe a white person wearing a headress at coachella would be seen the same way as a native american on a reservation .
Support,learning life skills from a parent ensures a child has someone to turn to for advice.,teachers will likely not be available for follow up questions.
Support,"certain countries may not have positive relationships, which can complicate international coordination.",chad is in conflict with many neighbouring regions .
Attack,enforcing vaccination will antagonize parents against governments and pharmaceutical companies and will lead to a more reduced amount of vaccinated children.,it is the responsibility of every government to inform the public and relieve society from such pressures.
Attack,national security is best served by the most able bodied; equal conscription would not be a good strategy as women have much less strenuous pt requirements that could lower total military effectiveness.,the current combat standards are not sufficient as they are arbitrary and do not account for age or gender. more realistic standards would help units in combat.
Attack,"religions originating from india including hinduism, buddhism, jainism and sikhism tend to have no strong stance against lgbtq actions.",not having a concrete position on lgbtq issued does not equate to acceptance of the lgbtq community.
Attack,"in some cultures, it is logistically very difficult to follow a meatless diet.",as a meatless diet does not restrict people in any common social situations it cannot be insociable.
Support,"there are a number of religious practices that have been outlawed, even though they have had a large following because they infringed on the rights of others.","the uk is set to follow many other countries in banning lgbtq conversion therapy , which is most often carried out on religious grounds: most notably by evangelical christian groups."
Attack,ontological arguments are inherently fallacious. one cannot simply define physical entities into existence.,"the parent is a misrepresentation of ontological arguments. ontological arguments don t define just anything into existence. they are attempts to prove god s existence from nothing but analytic, a priori and necessary premises to the conclusion that god exists. this is a far cry from defining an entity into existence."
Support,employers don't take mental health seriously . this exacerbates the stigma.,malicious co workers and employers could gossip about people's mental health problems and create a hostile work environment.
Support,"for example, the best possible world may include the ability to make significant moral choices. yet significant moral choices always involve the potential for suffering.",the potential for suffering is what makes choices morally significant.
Attack,john 10:30 states: 'jesus and the father are one.' this makes jesus the messiah.,"even if john's comments are true, this is not the criteria for determining the messiah."
Support,"luke is one of the most powerful force users of all time, so him eventually learning this ability is no surprise but there are good reasons why it took so long for him to learn how to use it.","luke had been cut off from the force for a long time, preventing him from the opportunity to discover and use this power."
Attack,"faith in god is very personal and intimate. no one knows the truth of, or in any religion. the only truth is what you believe.","truth is more then what you believe. no matter how hard someone believes a locked chest isn't locked, it doesn't change the truth that the chest is locked."
Support,"while there are changes that individuals can make, not all options are accessible and practical for all people.","it is difficult for people, some more than others, to switch to more climate friendly diets."
Support,"available data appears to show technology that is multigenerational, several generations ahead of what the u.s. consider next generation technology but another nation having developed technology that advanced long ago on their own is near impossible.",it is unlikely that nation s other than the u.s. possess technology that is more advanced than that of the u.s. to such an extent and including technology for such anomalous or ultra fast objects.
Attack,they can also use pencils for that. focusing on pencils the wrong focus.,some tools are more powerful than others; the fact that a malicious actor might use a pencil does not mean that uncontrolled proliferation of ai is safe.
Support,the roots of gender inequality are not only religious. atheism doesn't guarantee gender equality.,the existence of secular sexism proves that religion is not the main root of gender inequality.
Support,peer review of data is increasingly becoming the norm; the process occurs after data is gathered and may increase the reliability of the data as mistakes could be caught and the paper rejected .,"in a survey of 928 papers on climate change, no rejection of agw was found p. 1686 . such consensus would not be achieved if the peer review process found erroneous data."
Attack,it would be equally possible to strengthen the military of each state separately.,"greece spends more than 2.5 of its gdp on its national army p. 13 , and given the ongoing economic crisis there, it is unlikely they will be able to spend any more on it. the greek army can therefore not be strengthened independent of an eu army."
Attack,some of the events in the movie were overtly politicized with respect to the present day. these didn't really serve the plot and instead broke the illusion of star wars being a unique universe quite different to our own.,"star wars is not a unique universe. on the meta textual level it is created by people living now and like all art will reflect the values of the era it is made. some may argue it is impossible to create a universe different to our own because every decision every film maker makes is in some way informed by the environment they make them in. on a textual level star wars is set in our universe. it says it on screen in big letters. it is located in our universe but far, far away. ."
Attack,political challenges because of complex governance due to varying ideologies.,collective diplomacy: stronger negotiating power in international affairs.
Support,state control of the economy is required to protect the interests of the people.,privatized fire departments historically lead to subordinating human life to the motive of extracting profit.
Attack,an increase in the number of drug users and addicts will have extremely negative consequences for individuals and society.,addiction is only dangerous if stigmatized and untreated.
Attack,theologians closely linked to the pope have compared evangelicals in the us to terrorists.,pope francis has insisted that evangelicals and catholics work closer together and repair their political divides.
Attack,assuming the rebels will counter this technology is a fallacious appeal to probability .,the history of technology both in the real world and in the star wars universe is one of advancement and counter. to conclude something else would happen is willful incredulity.
Attack,"asset tends to elect moderates, because losing candidates would band together and compromise to beat the winners from the other party.","if this were true, then it would happen regardless of the input of voters, and candidates could instead just be given an equal amount of votes to negotiate between themselves, with the same outcome."
Support,"negative political advertising is more effective than positive political advertising. therefore, if candidates have less money to spend, then they will likely focus more on negative advertising.",in the 2012 us presidential election campaign only 14.3 of political ads aired were classified as positive.
Attack,"since capitalism was envisioned as a system to maximize personal freedom, the existence of capitalist dictatorships demonstrates a disconnect between economic systems and the freedoms they promise.","although there are some examples of human rights violating capitalist dictatorships, these have not lasted long; a stable capitalist system must, in practice, observe human rights."
Support,"a right to healthcare would increase federal spending as more people would need access to healthcare, thereby increasing the us debt or deficit.","when people don t have to worry about medical bills or debt collectors, they tend to use more healthcare which increases costs ."
Attack,"science works on certain assumptions, one of the key assumptions is positive evidence justifies positive claims. in the absence of positive evidence no claim should be made.","this is the same as saying that science has starting assumptions that aren't compatible with the types of claims religion makes. if the difference is that foundational, there is no strong reason to prefer either set of arbitrary commitments, per lyotard."
Attack,us medicaid drug price controls led to decreases in discounts from manufacturers and increases in prices for many consumers.,other western democracies have state empowered agencies who negotiate drug prices on behalf of everyone and they get a better deal than the us system achieves. it is a fact that drug prices are higher in the us than nearly anywhere.
Attack,"sexual advances from co workers are considered sexual harassment. as such, the same behaviour by strangers is likely to be viewed more negatively.",asking for sex violates the expectation of professionalism in a workplace. this does not apply when interacting with strangers in public settings.
Attack,medical guidelines state that prepubescent transgender children should not be offered any hormonal interventions to protect their fertility.,medical guidelines merely restrict the provision of gender affirming care to minors. they do not attribute this age restriction to fertility.
Attack,"economically, a unified korean peninsula will generate vasts amounts of wealth.","these estimates and projections assume ideal conditions, when in fact the realities of unification are much messier and much more costly."
Support,"food is fresher, healthier, and possibly tastier from the lack of food miles.",food does not spoil as easily when eaten off the plant.
Attack,government provision of health care is likely to create a very inefficient system.,a private health care sector can also be inefficient due to variances in pricing .
Support,violations of copyright law are becoming less frequent.,"many find streaming services , like spotify, to be a more convenient way to listen to music than downloading songs from pirating websites."
Support,a review of the empirical literature concluded that male to female gender affirming surgery improves quality of life in patients.,"the positive findings were derived using retrospective reports . given that the success of a medical procedure is evaluated using both objective and subjective metrics, these findings attest to the overall effectiveness of such procedures."
Attack,oil palm plantations in indonesia and malaysia pose significant threats to endangered elephants and tigers.,plant oil is consumed by so many uses that it is independent to a choice between eating meat or the alternatives.
Attack,many wars have had religious backgrounds and millions of people have died because of religion.,it does not follow that religions should not be studied because religions have had negative consequences.
Support,there is no instance in the bible of kingship passing to someone by inheritance on their mother's side.,"ancient israelite culture was strongly patriarchal, and women had very limited roles."
Attack,"like most organized religions, islam is necessarily hierarchical. in patriarchal societies and cultures, such hierarchies protect and extend male dominance, where women are systemically excluded from participation and decision making.",there is no central institutional hierarchy of clergy in islam.
Attack,"the concept of a mahram exists to protect women from the dangers of society , rather than to impose a discriminatory code onto them.","in 80 90 of reported sexual assaults, the victim knows their attacker ; women are more at risk of being assaulted by their mahram or intimate partners than by strangers."
Attack,ai could improve learning outcomes for every student via individualised teaching methods.,individualised teaching methods might prevent students from being exposed to divergent viewpoints and interests.
Support,rail guns : a canon that launches a projectile at extremely high velocity using electromagnetic forces. the projectile is launched across a pair of conductive rails. example: ship mounted rail guns on vessels in 'the expanse'.,"a rail gun is capable of completely penetrating any medium sized vessel, causing serious internal damage."
Attack,society treats most animals poorly. zoos are no different.,"the degree of utility humans gain from other interactions with animals e.g. pet keeping, meat eating is far greater than the marginal enjoyment that zoos provide."
Support,"in certain jobs or areas, people with commonly discriminated against characteristics might be even better than those without.","lesbians tend to make more than straight women, in something known by economists as the lesbian premium ; meriting a higher salary implies they may be better at their jobs."
Attack,"applying makeup in public places is considered uncouth . for this reason, women need to use private spaces like bathrooms to re apply makeup.","applying makeup in public is judged harshly because it breaks the illusion that women just wake up like that . therefore, such baseless infringements of women's liberties should be challenged, nor upheld."
Support,many radical groups have accepted power sharing agreements and joined the political systems of recognized governments.,northern ireland managed to form a government in 2007 between the democratic unionist party and sinn fein both of which have historic paramilitary links. this suggests that former terrorist organizations can be integrated into government more easily after peace has been established.
Attack,the free market ensures better quality of healthcare than a regulated system could.,the existing market based system is unable to provide a high quality of healthcare for many.
Support,this is a slippery slope logical fallacy. advocates of political correctness generally agree that politically incorrect statements are those that would offend a disadvantaged or discriminated against group in society.,"not only advocates of political correctness, there is an established definition in this debate of language or behavior that can be seen as excluding, marginalizing, or insulting groups of people considered disadvantaged or discriminated against and that certainly can't be applied to any speech ."
Support,competition could be divided into 'enhanced' and 'normal' categories. any legal enhancement would be allowed in 'enhanced' competition.,sports are a form of entertainment. there will be a time when a separate category for peds is created. the audience will then dictate with their wallets whether this is to stay or go. i believe that it will overtake traditional sports with dramatic action.
Attack,the eye is irreducibly complex. attempts to explain it's origin are nothing but just so stories.,scientists can explain the origin of complex eye structures quite well.
Attack,the cinematographies of the star wars movies are products of their respective eras. it is therefore difficult to compare them with each other.,"some choices about cinematography are clearly better than others. whereas the original trilogy has a coherent look, the prequels have been criticized for the uneven quality and over use of their digital effects as well as the uncanny valley problem of their digital protagonists."
Attack,the confederate ideology wasn't a hateful ideology at the time. the concept of secession had nothing to do with hate and everything to do with a fight for independence.,the confederacy did not allow independent political action to its sizable minority of abolitionists and black people.
Support,the nature of mass data collection makes it virtually impossible to have real regulation and oversight given the confidential nature of data collected and the operations of the intelligence community.,"mass data collections operate on a system of secrecy where normal citizens are expected to trust that they are done properly. however, since there is no transparency, there is no way to gauge the limits within with intelligence agencies are operating."
Attack,"often, people are unaware of how restrictions may violate their rights personally. this may be why speech restrictions are not controversial.",most people will likely not be affected by these laws as they do not widely spread misinformation or hate.
Support,"if there is a god or gods, then praying to a second one, extant or not, may infuriate the first.",christians and jews are expressly forbidden from worshiping or recognising the existence of any other god.
Support,high income countries could instead increase financial donations to the united nations refugee agency unhcr .,donating to the unhcr is widely believed to be one of the most effective ways to help refugees.
Support,"hatred can influence economic policy, further exacerbating inequality.",racial hatred is a powerful factor that influences public spending on welfare and food stamps.
Support,"gender predates the invention of gender segregated bathrooms; therefore, they neither cause nor significantly contribute to any gendered hierarchies.","in some deeply sexist ancient civilizations , like ancient rome , gender neutral bathrooms were the norm. this shows that gendered bathrooms are not inevitably attributable to gender inequality."
Attack,"a terminator, soulless machines designed for temporal combat. terminator series","the coolness of something as a weapon includes how cool it makes the wielder. wielding a terminator means giving it orders, sending it off, and waiting somewhere safe, which is uncool."
Support,governments should not prioritize certain forms of relationships over others.,individuals opt into relationships because these bring unique and profound meaning to their lives.
Attack,the state should not force religous organisations to engage in acts of compelled speech . this is what the state would be doing if it forced religious organisations to hire individuals that will preach values that the organisation disagrees with.,"there is no guarantee that someone who is hired will speak in a way which disagrees with the religious organisation. they are not hired due to an identity characteristic over which they have no control, not due to what they may or may not say."
Support,ceasing to produce meat would be extremely harmful to low income countries.,"the farming of animals for meat can be problematic. for example, when the practice involves using land to produce food for animals at the expense of food for people. however, i stayed in poor villages in indonesia where pigs and chickens were fed scraps or scratched for grubs. those chickens and pigs did not take any food that was otherwise edible for people and i felt ok to eat the meat they produced."
Support,data suggest that many americans are bad at managing money.,"us adults are among the most financially literate in the world. therefore, it is reasonable to expect that people in many other countries would be even worse at handling a ubi."
Attack,mainstream media cannot be held responsible for the content of fringe outlets or online discussion boards.,"when mainstream media outlets openly downplay the threat fringe beliefs, they become complicit."
Attack,"with online learning, schedules are more flexible .",the future of education is based on a responsive scheduling instead of a flexible or fixed schedule.
Attack,"for example, as the yimby movement has pointed out a major cause of the housing crisis is regulation preventing new housing from being built where it is needed.",that many problems are caused by contemporary market economics and that many could be solved by changing contemporary economics both do not preclude that many problems are caused or made more severe by government measures.
Support,this would allow people to scientifically study the impact of these drugs on the human body for the first time.,"this would allow athletes to dope more effectively, which increases the overall quality of sports."
Support,"russia's invasion of ukraine has made nato stronger , not weaker.","in response to russia's invasion, germany significantly increased its military and security commitments."
Attack,"someone who is not currently a christian would not believe that jesus being the true messiah is a reasonable possibility, otherwise they would have been christian before.","someone may have believed that he was the messiah before he died, but be thrown into doubt after he died. the belief in the resurrection would have rescued the original belief."
Attack,"those who use contraception are informed of this in advance by way of patient information leaflets and therefore, by choosing to have sex regardless, acknowledge and bear responsibility for this risk.",not all pregnancies are a result of an individual voluntarily choosing to have sex .
Support,"holding money in multiple currencies has many benefits , such as protecting the individual from hyperinflation and negating costly fees and commission when dealing with the foreign exchange market.","cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin, can help contain hyperinflation that can be associated with fiat currencies."
Attack,"while there are examples of religious intolerance, there are also examples of religion tolerance when several faiths have coexisted peacefully.","long periods of harmony have been used an excuse for wrongdoing for as long as there's been wrongdoing. she's a pillar of the community it's his first offence she runs a charity he employs thousands of people . they don't mean anything. the victim is still dead, ostracized or mutilated."
Support,"if the existence of god could be understood through rationality, humans would not have debated the topic for over 1000 years.","at some point, believe in god requires faith, believe and you will see the truth , instead of what racionality says see to believe"
Attack,a generation of british women went largely unmarried after world war one due to the large number of men who died in the war.,"the uk population is nearly split between males and females, and the distribution is within normal parameters compared to the rest of the world, demonstrating that male only conscription did not have significant long term demographic effects."
Support,"sexual orientation is not a choice because if it were, nobody would choose a homosexual orientation .","homophobic attempts to suppress homosexuality over centuries prove that homosexual attraction is innate, since homophobia can be so deadly to homosexuals that nobody would choose it as a way of life simply in order to avoid being killed. similarly, centuries of sexual repression among christianised heterosexuals has not resulted in provably less heterosexual activity."
Support,many psychological problems are rooted in bodily experiences and are treated as such. gender affirming care similarly seeks to alter one's body to reduce the associated distress.,"bodily insecurity about different body parts is often resolved with cosmetic surgery. breast reductions , nose jobs and veneers are all widely accepted treatments."
Attack,"indirect democracies, too, can turn a once tolerant public towards hatred. example are russia's legislation regarding homosexuals, hungary's migration campaigns, etc.","indirect democracies can turn the public to toleration as well, which was violating the minority rights before."
Attack,"many of the new testament authors were martyred because of what they believed. plausibly, they would not have willingly died for a narrative they had fabricated.","we don't know who wrote most of the nt, and so don't know that they were martyred."
Attack,"some crimes deserve the death penalty, no other punishment sufficiently acknowledges the pain caused to the victim s and society.",the death penalty does not sufficiently punish criminals as they will not experience the long term struggles of imprisonment.
Support,"with rising starting wealth inequality, increased cutbacks to schooling and other public services, and the rise of austerity backing governments 'equality of chance' is an ideal that many capitalist countries are moving further away from.","austerity or other forms of budget cuts are expected in as many as 159 countries next year , representing 85 of the global population."
Attack,social media sites facilitate the promotion of disordered eating.,social media is taking proactive steps to reach out to individuals suffering from eating disorders.
Attack,globalism makes wars far less likely to break out.,"nationalism, as a political ideology, does not call for war."
Support,driving a car is acceptable even though there is a potential for injury.,"the risks of driving outweigh those related to masturbation. if driving is acceptable despite having a much higher potential for injury, masturbation should be acceptable too"
Support,"it is true that self evident and incorrigible propositions are properly basic; however, there must be more types that are properly basic as well. otherwise, everyone is irrational since we commonly accept numerous beliefs that are not based on evidence and that are neither self evident nor incorrigible.","take the belief that the world was not created five minutes ago with built in memory traces, food in our stomachs from the breakfasts we never really ate, and other appearances of age. surely it is rational to believe that the world has existed longer than five minutes, even though there is no way to prove this. therefore, the evidentialist s criteria for properly basicality is flawed."

Attack,"mergers tend to lead to many losing their jobs due to corporate downsizing , from being individually fired, to entire offices being shut down.","corporate downsizing is not an inevitable consequence of mergers. through effective planning, the merging companies can achieve corporate rightsizing , wherein new jobs are created to ensure that no human resource is wasted."
Attack,"there is no way to guarantee the absence of coercion in the context of euthanasia, and thus we should not take that risk.","the same could be said of any medical procedure which comes with their own set of risks. still, society allows them."
Support,"dating can be a very difficult, unpleasant process, so the fact that arranged marriage does not necessitate it is a benefit for many.","some people do not have the required social skills to independently meet, set up, and go on dates with potential romantic partners. arranged marriages help such people to find a marital partner without dating."

Attack,"the vast majority of palestinians, by virtue of being muslims, have a strong religious connection to the territory.","islam is a religion that historically started in mecca, saudi arabia. judaism is a religion that can be historically traced to the kingdom of israel. muslims have a very strong religious claim to saudi arabia and jews have a very strong religious claim to israel."
Attack,climate change and its effects may be more politically divisive than the attempts to fight it are.,"in europe, populist policy is often nativist , meaning that it is highly anti immigration. this limits sympathy for other nations, which is typically necessary to persuade people to make climate change limiting sacrifices."
Support,"evidence based practice, policy, and procedure protocols require scientists to determine what should be done based on what does happen.","for example, if research scientists conduct a study and find that physical exercise improves cardiac health, then this evidence of what is true will be used to provide the medical recommendation that people should exercise."
Support,us courts have not precluded the idea that limitations can be introduced on the right to procreate.,"state v. oakley 2001 , a wisconsin supreme court case, introduced limitations on the right to procreate in the context of child support payments pp. 447 448 ."
Attack,"if the astrological readings did not prove to be true, then people would have stopped reading them long ago.",the fact people believe their astrological readings mapped on to their real life does not confirm astrology's predictive power.
Attack,"only physical laws can be objective. a law that doesn't change the behavior of particles of matter is nominal, never knowable, cannot be debated, and doesn't really exist.","all things that exist, even things in the mind, have some physicality quarks, gluons, etc. . things that are physical are objective. since moral facts are just mental states, morality is objective."
Attack,publicly funding higher education will not make a huge difference. inequalities would have been entrenched in primary and secondary schooling by then.,"it might not make a huge difference, but it might make a very significant difference to individuals who can go on to achieve great things."
Attack,"sexual chemistry is integral to a happy and lasting relationship. as such, individuals should assess their chemistry with each other early on.","sexual chemistry can be purely temporary, as often characterised by the honeymoon period , and as such is not a good marker of a future positive relationship."

Support,the failure of the camp david negotiations in 2000 were the result of israel's unacceptable demands.,israel demanded a demilitarized state p. 16 . this would have abrogated palestine's right to self determination.
Support,"this implies that only those who can afford to own or contract out a private vehicle are worthy of not facing harassment for accessing medical services, which is in itself classist.","in the us, women account for only 51 of licensed drivers. this means that almost half of the women are being alienated because they are unable to drive to the clinics themselves."
Support,"a number of biblical passages are better understood as fiction , allegory , or metaphor rather than literal truth, so their lack of conformity with evidence is not necessarily problematic.",christianity has a short history of strict or literal interpretation of scripture p. 308 ; many christian denominations do not insist on biblical literalism or infallibility .
Attack,"the study talks about calories. vegetables are more calorie dense as in calories kg than meats. if we look at the numbers for protein production, the result would be the opposite, since meat is much more protein dense than vegetables. calories alone are not sufficient for a healthy diet, and protein malnutrition can be fatal.",the calorie is a more basic and important indicator of nutrition than protein content.
Attack,"reducing meat consumption and food waste would go a long way in mitigating food shortage around the world, particularly in poorer countries.","rates of meat consumption are highest in rich nations . therefore, reduced meat consumption in rich countries is unlikey to mitigate food crises in poorer countries; in fact, the outcomes can be negative , from a nutritional, economic, and environmental point of view."
Support,"if in recent years, decades or the future in particular commercial entities, possibly supported by state actors, manufacture and or operate any aav displaying highly advanced anomalous flight characteristics, these are more likely to be the result of reverse engineering and or retrieval and or transfer of non human intelligence origin vehicles, than of own human research. thus, the extraterrestrial origin beings explanation or another exotic one would be the correct one even in such cases.","if there were indeed aliens on earth and flying craft to recover and study, then federal agencies would certainly want to study these and likely initially in secret."
Attack,presidents of republics and other officials also enjoy wealthy lifestyles funded by taxes.,"some of those officials are democratically elected and, when they are not, unlike monarchs, their terms are limited to a certain period and are not inheritable."
Support,baby dedications are a better way to entrust infants to god.,this is why they have dedications instead of having to baptize your baby. a child in general should be able to make that decision once old enough to understand why they are getting baptized based off of a personal choice.
Support,"arab minorities in france have never been accepted by the white majority, even if they tried to assimilate .",the famous cover of douce france sweet france by maghrebi french rock group carte de séjour was so noteworthy because its perceived irony clearly exposed the gate keeping of french identity.
Support,"if all people are expected to take the same actions, it is likely the actions would be minor measures, which would see some individuals having to do significantly less than they can or should do.",flat tax rates are usually low and insufficient because they are set to accommodate people across economic classes.
Attack,"religions can provide an easier, more organised way of presenting and teaching moral behaviour.","while religion may present moral values in a more organized manner, it is not necessarily the case that it teaches the best moral values."
Support,capitalism punishes choosing well being over profits.,companies that give more money to charities that maximize well being will have less money to compete against other companies with.
Attack,"making a decision with a small majority is a sign that the decision may well be the wrong one. most democratic changes should require a large majority, with the exception of time sensitive changes, which could be handled by the executive branch.",this may give too much power to the executive branch.
Support,"some choices about cinematography are clearly better than others. whereas the original trilogy has a coherent look, the prequels have been criticized for the uneven quality and over use of their digital effects as well as the uncanny valley problem of their digital protagonists.",the computer generated background used in the prequel trilogy create an uneven visual texture where character lighting and background lighting are often poorly matched contrasting with the original trilogy where practical sets provided appropriate lighting.

Attack,"although spaces organized by sex can generally address biological needs p. 228 , they do not adequately account for social factors . spaces organized by gender can include such considerations, and are therefore superior.",women only spaces organized by sex have historically addressed numerous social issues .
Attack,"all belief systems theism, atheism, agnosticism, polytheism, etc. are all held without full proof, and as such fall under the the study of philosophy. science and philosophy are completely different subjects. science cannot deny or justify atheism, and it cannot deny or justify theism. science can only refute based upon logic and facts. if you take philosophy in college, it is usually in a completely different building than the science courses.","atheism is not a belief system. atheism is a position in response to a single claim. god exists. if you do not believe god exists you are an atheist, if you believe there is insufficient evidence to believe in god, you are an atheist. in other terms a belief system is presented and atheists reject the presented belief system as lacking sufficient evidence to be supportable."
Support,"monotheism does not preclude the existence of evil, insofar as some of the features of the traditional conception of god can be abandoned without rejecting the traditional conception of god in toto in its entirety .","if god is merely the unmoved mover or the first cause in the long chain of cause and effect, evil could have arisen well outside the scope of god's influence."

Support,"certain groups of people cannot easily travel by public transport, even if provision, organization, accessibility, and reliability are excellent.",parents with young children struggle on public transport.
Attack,"a heathy vegan diet is theoretically possible, but it is extremely hard to maintain such a diet long term without consuming any animal products, unless you take an industrial preconceived super balanced food.","with an increase in vegetarians and vegans, there would be more allowances made and techniques developed to assist in maintaining these diets, making it easier and healthier to maintain them."
Attack,allowing only law enforcement and military forces to bear arms would decrease the level of danger and violence experienced by individuals in society.,guns being in the hands of civilians is not the cause of violence. people are more than capable of violence without using guns.

Support,"lenin statues in the us are not in any way comparable to confederate memorials as there are only five and none of them is in public premises: two are in private hotels casinos, one is in an apartment building, one belongs to an art gallery and the last one is for sale and displayed outdoor a retail property.","as lenin statues are on private premises and located there by their owners, their removal by any form of government would indeed be an attack to the first amendment ."
Attack,the need for bathroom access is a universal human experience.,"while access might be a universal need, the forms and options for access might not be universally equitable. while a urinal might be available for a woman, it would not be a useful substitute for a toilet."
Support,banning virginity certificates would do little to promote the sexual autonomy and empowerment of women.,"there are several other routes through which women can prove their virginity. examples include hymen reconstruction surgery, which is more commonly sought than are virginity certificates."
Support,historical accounts of different events in the old testament are often confused to be contradictions.,the ark made by moses referred to in deuteronomy 10:1 3 is different from the ark of the covenant mentioned in exodus 37:1 and built by bezalel .

Attack,"as we have seen from various poorly trained ai models , a poorly trained agi could lead to disastrous effects.","such agi in specific is unlikely to gain sufficient capabilities or power to cause such damage. it's either well trained or highly powerful. minor issues in training could also cause great problems in slightly impactful ai, but these are likely different types of problems than what is put into spotlight here."
Attack,"the enlightened despot is a single point of failure if anything happens to them, the government is crippled. democracy's distributed leadership is much more resilient.","an enlightened dictator requires good sense, character and fortitude. many people possess those personal characteristics, indicating a significant pool of potential successors."

Attack,"no true scotsman fallacy special pleading. the descriptions are so similar that there is no reason to think they are different. all the ancient religions have spiritual experiences, as do most modern cults. the only difference is cultural interpretation.","in fact, non christian religious experience, such as buddhist or hindu religious experience, is typically very different from christian experience. there is no reason to think that non veridical religious experiences are indistinguishable from the witness of the holy spirit."
Attack,children do not contribute in any way and even remove adults from the work force to care for them. increasing the abortion rate would be a good thing.,"children will contribute later, which becomes increasingly important as societies age. in germany less than 13 of heavily disabled people are workless: www.dgb.de"

Attack,"while the pope is not responsible for the shortcomings of previous administrations, he has a moral responsibility to right wrongs done by previous administrations.",the pope is not solely responsible for reform. the vatican's administration team continues to block changes that pope francis is proposing.
Attack,"mass data collection is usually just sifting through a huge amount of data with very few relevant bits of information, most of which end up to be false positives.","due to the confidential nature of information gathered from mass data collection, it is more likely that the role of these sources has been underestimated than is likely with more 'traditional' sources."
Support,a small family size allows women to participate in the workforce and increase household income.,"a desire for a large family appears to hamper women's ability to stay in the workforce; specifically, women who will go on to have many children are most at risk for leaving the workforce."
Attack,the state must take into consideration the future implications of a policy when implementing it.,"unconceived future children, either as specific intended children or as future generations, have no current ontological status and thus no current interests or rights."
Attack,schools could adopt various measures to limit the potential for distraction caused by mobile phones.,"any measures adopted by schools are likely to be circumvented, as students often break rules in school."
Support,confederate flags and monuments are symbols of solidarity to rural working class americans . many of them feel forgotten as globalization has reduced opportunities for rural blue collar life. tearing down monuments sends a message that the country wants to forget them altogether.,"it is possible that whitelash led some voters in michigan, wisconsin, and pennsylvania to vote for trump in 2016. if so, removing monuments might lead to more racist candidates winning."
Support,"the arts, literature and music are all invaluable cultural resources which define people and their origins.","the arts literature, music, etc. are one of the most powerful tools in society when it comes to cultural transmission ."
Attack,freedom and liberty are important parts of the american lifestyle. an absence of that freedom is therefore a grave injustice.,american libertarian ideas sometimes lead to situations where free interpretation of freedom is causing active harm to the country.
Attack,"using ai could ultimately bring down costs for schools , as they may replace other technology and possibly even some staff.","in the short term, ai would be expensive and would require extensive training to fully apply it to education."
Attack,"infants are not developmentally capable of understanding abstract concepts such as sin, redemption, and salvation. therefore, they can be regarded to be saved, by default.","our need for salvation is based on our descent from adam , and is therefore not related to our stage of development."
Attack,approaching a stranger for sex requires a level of vulnerability that equalizes the playing field between the pair.,"approaching a stranger for sex, considered by some to be a private matter, could make them uncomfortable, regardless of the vulnerablity of the person approaching."

Support,"a primary source must be an immediate, first hand accounts of a topic, from people who had a direct connection with it. the gospels all deal with events where the supposed author was not present at. matthew, mark and john were all younger than jesus and could not have witnessed his birth.","the gospels are not independent. for example, matthew and luke use mark as a source. so they are demonstrably not all primary sources."
Support,removal of barriers for an entry in to the labor market is way better to fight poverty in the long term. this way poor people start to accumulate their own wealth.,the problems with 'capitalism' as it currently exists arise due to government intervention not in spite of it. the problems of monopoly and monopsony only arise due to government enforced restrictions to free enterprise.

Attack,"evolution is not the simpler answer, compared to creationism. apart from trying to comprehend mind boggling timescales of millions of years, it means we have to also consider the origins of the universe, which are equally beyond human experience .","creationism requires understanding of even more complex reality such that requires a transcendental creator, and a timeless scale in which it exists. this concept is far more incomprehensible: what is a million of years compared to infinity?"
Attack,there is no way to verify many of the accounts within the bible.,a tool often used to verify historical accounts physical evidence cannot be expected in the case of the bible.
Attack,"everyone knows the current system isn't designed for compromise, and is bloody.","some believe this is the most compromise possible of any system, and disregard immediately as naive attempts to show the underlying reality of how utilitarian ideals can unite and reveal the similarities of the public, while leading to better outcomes."

Attack,many historical documents match up with events recorded in the christian bible which were then corraborated by different disciplines of science. namely geography and archelogy,history or historical documentation is to be distinguished from science. those are fundamentally different things.
Support,christianity encourages followers to have children.,the bible instructs christians to be fruitful and multiply .
Attack,the vast majority of children who transition do not regret their decision.,"while regret may be low amongst adults who have transitioned, this number may increase if gender affirming surgery is delivered in childhood, as many children are seen to experience desistance ."
Support,"without legal recognition, agi will not be regarded as morally significant. this would likely lead to the objectification of agi, and objectification is morally wrong.","objectification poses a serious problem for the development of agi because the united nations educational, scientific and cultural organization unesco has identified an established trend of ai developers installing female voices and tones into their ai assistants in order to simulate subservience p. 104 5 ."
Support,moral relativism allows for more diverse rationales for morality and is often preferred over moral objectivism.,"morality can vary considerably depending on a number of factors, including culture, context, and individual perspective ."

Support,science is based on assumptions that cannot be objectively confirmed.,"scientists assume that the physical universe operates independent of our observations , although this cannot be proven."
Attack,early gender affirming procedures may lead to sterility before minors have had time to decide if they want to have their own children.,"having children is seen as extremely important in us society; therefore, it is likely that minors will consider this when they opt for procedures that could lead to sterilization."
Support,"although there is no guarantee that everyone acquiring a parenting license will be a better parent than if they hadn't, the desire to acquire the license will encourage prospective parents to learn, therefore encouraging self improvement in those who wish to procreate.","at the very least, focusing attention on a licensing system is likely to increase the belief that parenting is a skill and not an inherent ability. it is difficult to argue that increasing the amount of conversation and shared ideas would be detrimental to parenting."
Attack,"wearing a religious symbol could demonstrate a preference to teach according to religion and not science because many religions restrict knowledge considered incompatible with religious books, despite having been proven by science.",the standard of teaching is defined by the government or school administrators. teachers will already be aware of and have to adhere to this standard; they ll teach by those rules or face being fired.

Attack,the sengwer people of embobut forest in kenya were violently removed from their homes as the government repossessed their ancestral lands as part of a plan to reduce deforestation.,"a 2014 kenya forestry service report warned that more than 70 of the forest had been extensively degraded . this gives a valid reason to protect the forest from the native population, even if the methods used are abhorrent."
Attack,monogamy and sexual freedom are not mutually exclusive.,"by definition, sexual freedom and monogamy are incompatible concepts."
Support,"since god is good, it would be against his nature to disrupt free will.",forcing someone to do something is tyrannical and removes the intrinsic goodness of the voluntary act.
Attack,"even if one is permitted to remove trespassers under some cases without otherwise harming them, doing this using brutal violence seems unjustified. brutal violence is defined as an attack designed to inflict serious physical damage on someone else's body.",brutal violence is an emotionally loaded term that inaccurately describes the medical procedure that is abortion.

Support,"with today's gaming technology, pixel art style games are often a artistic choice rather than a technical limitation. it is invalid to imply pixel art style games are more prevalent than 3d games, so in that sense they aren't really overdone when comparing to the non pixel art games.","from an artistic point of view, it's just classic gaming lovers interacting with each other, so gamers are just enjoying the kind of games they love as much as they can."
Attack,"powerful political interest groups might be able to influence hate speech legislation, making it unfair and unevenly enforced or watered down.","the influence of political interest groups is not unique to hate speech. they influence every aspect of legislation , including whether or not legislation even gets passed."

Attack,"even if preventing childhood obesity is a justified goal, the societal condemnation of adults' obesity is not necessary.",targeting adults to achieve policy change is necessary because they are the voters.
Attack,astrology allows us to reliably predict the seasons and the tides which is extremely important for growing gathering food and feeding all people around the world as well as preparing for winters and summers. an example is a calendar which uses the moon and sun to reliably predict the seasons.,"forecasters use weather conditions, wind and air pressures, and special gauges to accumulate data which is then fed into computers and used to predict changes in tidal patterns."
Support,"animals and plants, like oak wilt and mosquitoes , both contribute to destroying the planet. it is not humans alone.","the dynamic between humans and the rest of the environment is the same as that between any other species and the rest of the environment. it is always one of competition over resources, with specialization and symbiosis only where those bring competitive advantage."

Attack,"according to studies, vegetarian diets were associated with a 53 greater risk of depression compared to a diet consumed by non vegetarians which can lead to worse lifestyles.","it also found that the studies rated to have the best quality, one study associated vegetarian vegan diets with either no risk or a higher risk of depression depending on the population and three studies associated these diets with a lower risk of depression . these were also much larger than the other studies which found found a negative effect except for the matta et al. 2018 study of volunteers."
Attack,there have been thousands of instances of child sexual abuse in single sex schools run by the catholic church.,the vatican's strong stance against sexual abuse of minors within the church is likely to tackle the issue in catholic schools.
Support,many believe that corporations abuse the current copyright laws in order to restrict legitimate use of their products.,"historically, individuals have abused patent trolling as an unfair avenue to restrict usage of their products and ideas . it is only fair to assume copyright laws have been similarly abused."
Attack,there is no evidence to support the assertions of shinto.,shinto belief supports the separation of religion and science into non overlapping magisteria .
Attack,modern day society uses a calendar that is measured from jesus' birth.,"this is only true in christianized society, making this a circular argument."
Support,"in ireland, a catholic baptism barrier to school enrollment leaves many atheist parents feeling under pressure to baptise their children in order to secure a place in their local school.","this can unfairly penalise children in the care system, who are 'disadvantaged' in applying to faith schools despite their vulnerable position."
Support,tourism creates employment in regions where employment through other means is not high.,"in a tiny island nation like maldives, tourism accounts for nearly 40 of all employment."
Attack,"the claim clearly describes how it is related and how it is dangerous: delaying climate change mitigation. moreover, it can make such much less efficient and effective.","delaying climate change mitigation and combat ing food and water scarcity are not related, so that point is irrelevant in this branch."
Attack,the possibility of dating and sex between fellow military service members can distract them from their duties and hurt morale and team readiness.,"by this logic, gay and lesbian individuals should not be allowed to serve in the military since they might be distracted by same sex members. yet, this is generally not seen as problematic."
Attack,heterosexuals can also be in any geographical location.,"the issue isn t that homosexuality is alone in this. the issue is with how this information factors into their behavior, and ultimately their effect. ."
Support,the last jedi clearly associates the presence and decisive influence of women with the good side whereas the first order on the bad side is run primarily by white men.,the last jedi generally displays its male characters with more commonly male traits if only to use them as a critique of so called toxic masculinity .
Support,"intersectional feminism promotes the welfare of non white, non heterosexual people over white, heterosexual men and women.","when integrated with activism, intersectionality enables people to centre minoritised communities in conversations, focusing on alleviating complex combinations of oppression though this may seldom occur."
Support,deliberately telescoped genealogies exist elsewhere in the bible .,numbers 16:1 gives a telescoped genealogy of korah.
Attack,"1. if i were a physical object e.g., a brain or body , then a third person physical description would capture all the facts that are true of me.","if physicalism is true then these supposed mental facts could some day be reduced, explained, or eliminated by science. just because we lack the capability to prove it right now does not mean we must resort to dualism."
Attack,faith is a defective epistemology. theism ultimately rests on faith which is choosing to be more confident in certain propositions than warranted by evidence alone.,"as no one can know any worldview is true with 100 certainty, all worldviews are ultimately chosen on some measure of faith. the measure of individual certainty could be 90 , 70 , or even 51 depending on the epistomological methods of the believer. however, the amount of certainty does not change the reality that all worldviews must be taken as true on some measure of faith to fill the remaining gap. facing this gap and accepting the worldview as true is what theists typically mean by faith."
Support,"matthew 1:23 cites isaiah 7:14 as pointing to the messiah, but it does not point to the messiah.","isaiah 7:14 is fulfilled in the verses that follow, isaiah 8:3 4 ."
Support,matthew 19:23 24 and luke 18:24 25 do not teach that it is absolutely impossible for a rich person to enter the kingdom of god.,"matthew 19:23 24 was referring to a literal gate in jerusalem called the eye of the needle, which a camel would have had a difficult but not impossible time getting through."
Attack,"gender neutral bathrooms will likely be designed with greater privacy , due to the mixing of multiple genders. as such, they may better meet the privacy needs of those with medical conditions.","as many facilities will likely be minimally renovated to become gender neutral, increased privacy is not a guarantee."
Attack,from 1972 until 1976 the us supreme court put a halt to capital punishment due to its conflict with basic rights.,"in the gregg decisions, the supreme court reinstated the death penalty, and the court maintained that the death penalty was constitutional under the eighth amendment."
Support,the movie did well to use humor as a tool to alleviate the pace and the emotional intensity of the film.,the purpose of this humor was never to get a bunch of laughter from the audience which makes the fact that the jokes didn't land very often to be more acceptable.
Attack,"in a country that has separation of church and state , religious morality should not dictate the law.","secular pro life organizations, movements, and individuals exist."
Support,"a monopoly , defined as a single person or enterprise being the only supplier of a good or service, is not inherently a bad thing if the monopolist is the most efficient producer of that good or service.","a monopoly would operate at a maximum economy of scale , which improves efficiency."
Attack,it is difficult to imagine how a successor for the ed could be found and or selected.,there are several mechanisms one could use to select an enlightened despot.
Attack,"hatred is only perceived as such due to the war. had the war not happened, and the secession gone clean cut for everyone, the idea of hatred might not have subsisted more than a couple of years",to think that the symbol of hatred stems from the war mischaracterizes why they are regarded as monuments to hatred. the confederacy would have been treasonous and embodied white supremacy and race based slavery irrespective of whether it had gone to war with the union.
Support,adults have the authority and capacity to consensually engage in many risky activities. football is no different.,"adults are allowed to participate in a host of dangerous activities for pleasure, such as mixed martial arts mma , wrestling, boxing, sword fighting , skydiving, cabling and rappelling, caving, cliff jumping and base jumping."
Support,"passages from the babylonian talmud accuse jesus of sorcery, which could be a reference to his miracles by his opponents.","sanhedrin 43a:20 accuses jesus of practicing sorcery, which could be a description of his miracles by one of his opponents."
Attack,"smoking cannabis shows no link to the development of lung cancer , unlike tobacco.",there is not yet a clear consensus on the risk of cancer for cannabis users.
Attack,"the uk has private health insurance companies, so citizens buy health insurance to pay for further coverage.","private insurance is available in the uk, but the premiums are way lower about one tenth of the price of u.s. private insurance since most healthcare is funded publicly."
Support,"if polygamy were legal, then less desirable men will be left without wives, leading to social instability .","given that polyandry is less common than polygyny across cultures, there would likely be far fewer available women than men if polygamy were to be allowed."
Support,game developers have no financial incentive to reduce violence in their games given how profitable they are.,"there are violent video games that have female protagonists. violence is profitable. no matter the gender, it will still be profitable."
Support,"during dates, many women are not given space to express themselves.","according to an article on quartz, during a date, many men are talking over women and not giving them a chance to speak."
Support,shinto shrines operate as a community hub and help provide followers with emotional support .,shinto festivals throughout the year create continuity and offer followers essential opportunities to experience communitas .
Attack,it s not always clear that publicly stated goals of political organizations are convincing on their own. the statements of purpose are only believable only if the approach is sound and the organization not prone to deceive others.,"arguing that though the stated goals of now are equality, they don t really want equality, because now is prone to deceive suggests the claimant knows the goals of groups like now better than the 500k members of now."
Attack,censoring hateful ideologies does not eradicate them; it merely reduces opportunities to engage and counteract such ideas.,engaging with fanatics through debate popularizes their views.
Attack,rising atmospheric co2 levels might reduce the nutritional level of food but they probably won't cause global food insecurity.,"this argument concerns co2 enrichment alone and does not consider climate related impacts to food security from changes in heat, precipitation and other factors."
Attack,reason alone can produce conflicting ideas of morality and reason alone cannot always break the tie.,"morality is not necessarily absolute, in which case multiple moralities can exist at the same time."
Attack,"modern society is highly specialized and requires specialized, not standardized, workers and citizens.",specialization is more appropriate in higher education. forcing children to specialize when they haven't fully explored their talents and preferences can lock them into pursuing a career they might later regret .
Attack,"president trump did so unilaterally without consulting south korea . much to the consternation of south korea and japan , two of america's traditional allies , somewhat straining relationships with them.",south korea deviated from a common us japan sk line first when they invited the north to the olympics in spring 2018.
Support,it is possible to love one's nation and still love every other nation too.,globalism and nationalism can both exist with or without love so it doesn t matter.
Attack,the harm principle holds that people's actions can be restricted when they put others at risk.,the harm principle stands for only restricting an action where it causes harm to others . not every bitcoin transaction causes harm to others so the harm principle only justifies restricting the use of bitcoin for criminal activity or other similarly harmful acts.
Support,populations and regions who converted to catholicism didn't become substantially more ethical a prime example is the christianization of the roman empire which didn't change e.g. the widespread slavery .,"in the roman empire, it caused greater religious intolerance and a much more persecutory state ."
Attack,"verbal abuse has been shown to lead to depression, low self esteem, self harm, and a myriad of social and emotional disorders.","pre existing mental conditions or predispositions cannot be disregarded as potential factors prior to harassment or bullying, and therefore, negative speech cannot be conclusively linked to mental health issues."
Support,"economically, a unified korean peninsula will generate vasts amounts of wealth.","according to the hyundai economic research center, unification costs amount to 706 billion usd over an10 18 year period, while revenue generated will equal 835 billion usd, for a net gain of usd 129 billion."
Attack,"in many nations, progressive legislation has allowed individuals who identify as trans women to access women only spaces. there is no link between allowing transgender people to use facilities that match their identity and violence against cis women.","on physical prowess indices, trans women outperform cis women . therefore, to the extent that women fear men because of their capacity to overpower them , women's fear of being assaulted by trans women is justified."
Attack,"certainly theories and theologies which make no sense and have no method of verification are worthy of our skepticism. however, if a theory has explaining power, makes sense and has support then it should be taken seriously.","there is no proof to believe in supernatural beings, besides speculation."
Support,gun control policies infringe on a number of rights that the us government was explicitly founded upon and has an obligation to uphold.,"the us founding fathers believed that the right to own a firearm was a necessary responsibility to resist tyranny, which is why it was codified in the second amendment ."
Support,"there's no fair way to ensure gender equality in future games without restriction people's choices, and their ability to play more gender specific games.","it is natural to assume that video games have limited amounts of time and resources to spend on a game. this means that male gamers could easily come to the conclusion that if video game developers spend more resources on including women, they'll have less to spend on men."
Attack,unification will disproportionately benefit the wealthy.,those without wealth will be freed of mandatory military service.
Attack,the ownership of the harry potter universe has shifted from being solely with j.k. rowling to being largely shared with the fans.,the characters and messages in harry potter are inextricably linked to j.k. rowling's world views and experiences.
Support,a populace being made up of people with good epistemic habits allows for the consistent proliferation of important information and exclusion of unimportant information.,epistemic habits determine what information a member attempts to share as important and what a member will take and consider to be important. accurate epistemic habits will allow for accurate estimations in this area.
Attack,the existence of a monarchy reduces the aspiration of ordinary citizens as they can never aspire to be the head of state.,"in most republics, it is impossible for ordinary citizens to become head of state. in the us, you need a huge amount of money just to be considered a viable candidate to run for office. the actual cost of campaigning and running for elections is left only in the hands of the pseudo aristocratic elite in democratic countries."
Attack,"it is physically impossible to visit every christian household in the world, slide down a chimney, deliver gifts, and fly away all in one day while remaining completely undetected.","a century ago, it would have been deemed impossible to ship products across the country within one day , as e commerce websites currently do. thus, just because something appears to be impossible does not mean that it actually is."
Attack,"hardship waivers provide critical support by allowing minors in difficult financial situations to earn much needed income. this feature is compassionate and adaptable, recognizing that some families might need the minor to contribute financially during challenging times.",minors will earn disproportionately less and would be subject to discrimination having not gained a diploma to make up for minimum years of experience in order to leave their minimum wage jobs
Support,"students can carry a limited number of physical books with them at any given point in time. when accessing online publications via their laptops, they are under no such limitations.",jstor provides access to over 12 million resources across 75 different disciplines.
Attack,"we would remember washington, jefferson, madison, and other slave owning founders even if they had not owned slaves. their contributions transcend the stain of slavery. confederate heroes, in contrast, are only remembered for defending slavery. whatever other qualities they may have possessed would not have resulted in monuments bearing their likenesses.","while white northerners and african americans remember confederate heroes only for defending slavery, many white southerners remember them more as defenders of their land and culture, and forget or do not think often of the role slavery played in this."
Support,mars colonization will help protect humanity and other species from extinction level events.,"in the future, worldly issues we currently face could get worse. colonizing mars helps these issues not get too big and for the human population to circumvent them before its negatively impacted."
Support,there are religious doctrines that should not be taught to children.,several religions hold the position that women are inferior or must be subordinate to men.
Attack,"even if steps 1 through 5 could be proven to be accurate, step 6 is not necessarily true. there could be conditions involved beyond what god simply wants. for example, if god gave man free will, he finds it important. proof of god's existence takes away some of man's choice. also, if faith is important, proof of god's existence negates some of the need for faith.","if you don't believe and ask god for proof of his existence, you won't receive it. there is no problem with free will in this case."
Support,"the founder of scientology, l. ron hubbard , was not an ethical or trustworthy person.","l. ron hubbard was a bigamist , and he absconded to cuba with his daughter, against her mother's wishes , despite being unable to care for her."
Attack,"art produced by ai is, thus far, derivative and deconstructed, both of which are protected and neither require any compensation on the part of the owners of the original work; e.g. andy warhol doesn t owe campbell s anything just because he painted their soup can.","copyright and american ip law have a legal concept of amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole for derivative works. there is not a hard and fast rule, but generally the less of the original present in a derivative work, the less a derivative work is in violation, with a special carve out for the heart of a work, which is, of course, open to interpretation. see the copyright alliance interpretation of the copyright office law ."
Attack,"a human with no brain would have no behavior. therefore, a brain is a necessary and sufficient prerequisite to any behavior in humans.","having a brain is clearly a necessary condition for all behavior, but the preponderance of people failing to act on rational knowledge in their possession e.g., procrastinators, victims of ptsd, drug addicts, etc. strongly suggests that having a brain is not a sufficient condition for behavior."
Attack,"this would be problematic as the state would be actively propping up those marriages which people want to break out of, possibly compelling people to stay in relationships with abusers or controlling spouses who make their lives worse.",the system could provide an exception to accelerate the process in cases of domestic violence as an egregious exception.
Attack,"during the gilded age of us history, where there were very few regulations of any sort, monopolies were quite common.","the gilded age was also a period of rapid economic growth, which doubled the per capita income , indicating that organically formed monopolies as opposed to monopolies imposed by regulations could be beneficial for overall living standards."
Support,"if nobody follows up on claims, no hard evidence as in unambiguous solid public proof can be provided. scientists have largely ignored the subject until 2021, there are a number of allegations of suppression of in depth investigations, and politicians may have feared for repercussions on their public image or found the claims as absurd as most others who heard of them.","that elusive but otherwise large and investigations justifying evidence base is in some ways akin to religion such as by comprising or investigating lots of testimonial evidence such as witness reports and experiencer accounts as well as when seen in an isolated manner rather ambiguous data basis next to prevalent discontempt with the neglection, ignorance and ridicule of the subject by the scientific community would rather make a case for a weakening of science than an overall boost."
Support,"by catering equally to both male and female gamers as opposed to neglecting one gender in favor of another, the video game industry would be able to better capitalize on both male and female demographics.","gender equality can significantly contribute to the creative succes of video games by creating original and thoughtful characters that fit convincingly inside their game universe , thus generating more profit."
Attack,"in polygamous families, parents may direct their attention towards finding new mates, rather than investing in their children.","child neglect is not unique to one form of marital arrangement: it can occur in situtions where parents are divorced, unhappily married, or in a polygamous relationship."
Support,"deception is commonly used by parents. if it is wrong for parents to make their children believe in santa claus, then they must not be allowed to perpetuate any other myths, lies, or forklore as well.",parents use boogeyman stories to scare their children into doing things they otherwise would resist. this may be not only helpful but also necessary to teach children good behavior.
Support,private organizations and companies are often willing to spend large amounts of capital on research.,the bill and melinda gates foundation invested 140 million in aids research.
Attack,"the process of gender identity development does not differ significantly between trans and cis children , and establishes itself at a very young age in both groups. this implies that identifying with a gender not consistent with one's sex assigned at birth is part of normal human development.","studies suggest that transgender and gender nonconforming people are associated with a higher rate of child abuse victimization , which may play a role in identity development."
Support,support for israel is one of the few uniquely bipartisan issues in the us.,both democrats and republicans overwhelmingly support israel.
Support,"it is challenging for ideas to develop complexity without criticism from opposing viewpoints, even when these ideas embrace pluralistic thought.",the adaptation and reform of the free market economy could be attributed to the global critique stemming from socialist perspectives.
Attack,"humanity is undoubtedly going to cause the next mass extinction ; already, all varieties of animal are being wiped out at a rate comparable to the previous five known mass extinctions.",mass extinctions aren't necessarily detrimental to life; they can actually increase the diversity of species on earth.
Support,many people have been able to bypass the nsfw content filters on chatgpt like tools in order to have sexually explicit interactions .,"people can often use creative language, euphemisms, or slang that is not explicitly flagged by filters, using terms such as netflix and chill."
Attack,social media has actually been responsible for helping promote the spread of democracy.,"states, like china, have proven themselves more than able to simply take down social media sites ."
Attack,"a ubi may erode the personal and societal incentives for financial responsibility, self improvement, and hard work; at least for some people.",existing welfare schemes reduce people's incentive to work because earning more money reduces the number of benefits they accrue. a ubi fixes this and actually provides a higher marginal return to earning an income .
Attack,"among those negative habits are negative epistemic habits, which are almost universally recognized as negative when viewed in isolation.",those may not get taught alongside various psychological matters and don't really fit into the label of psychology either.
Support,"the more social pressure there is on certain kinds of research, the more interest and attention it garners. this has several upshots that enhance objectivity.","when the scientific community are tasked with addressing pressing issues, this can often result in dramatically increased funding . better funding often yields superior quality research."
Support,research funding models can introduce political bias.,"any time you try to divide up scarce resources, especially public resources, people will compete for these resources. this competition is politics."
Support,"in the case of other industries where safety features and equipment are mandate, there are independent regulatory bodies which certify that the product meets the required standards.",underwriters laboratory establishes national us standards and certifies the effectiveness and smoke detectors in the us. ul does not manufacture smoke alarms or profit in any way from promoting their use.
Attack,cities could subsidize these businesses with the money saved from having to constantly repair roads and other infrastructure due to damage from cars.,"subsidizing automotive businesses in cities where cars were banned would be a waste of resources. for example, it would not make sense to subsidize the high end car showrooms found in major cities if they were prevented from effectively selling cars."
Attack,"if school level gender segregation is outlawed, then such a policy would likely be followed even at the classroom level.",the existence of gender segregated bathrooms and sporting teams in mixed sex schools is proof that a school level admission policy has no implications for other institutional policies.
Attack,most anti abortion activists feel very strongly about preventing murder. it seems highly unlikely that they would condone committing murder.,"one might justify killing a person if that person is a murderer. hence, pro life activists have killed doctors in the past."
Attack,a vegan society would cause singificantly less harm to wildlife.,"if all humans go vegan, entire ecosystems could be disrupted by the overpopulation of livestock if they were released into the wild."
Support,many states are not secular. it would not make sense to be concerned about the separation of church and state in these countries.,some states are theocracies and actively invoke religion in their sense of statehood and lawmaking.
Support,"global veganism could help eradicate world hunger, the greatest health crisis facing humankind in the long term p. 1 .",global veganism would reduce food and health inequality.
Attack,"using the same rationale, humans are also making the most horrible contributions to the world through pollution, and mass destruction of life and environments. this would justify prioritising animal life over humans. so 'valuable contributions' is an arbitrary argument that should not be used to defend the claim.","the damage humans cause to the planet is undeniable. however, the planet is only worth saving insofar as there are entities that are able to attribute worth to it. the extent to which other animals can do this is undoubtedly, and massively, inferior."
Attack,"the feeling of safety provided by gun control is illusory, since many other items such as knives, cars , bombs , and other weapons can be just as easy to use and as lethal as firearms but with far looser regulation.","in response to violence, laws, recommendations, and regulations have been put in place to restrict access to and limit damage by these items."
Support,there is a higher risk of unhappiness in an arranged marriage.,"many arranged marriages are entered into in the absence of love, which research suggests is a key to the health and happiness of humans and their relationships ."
Attack,"teenage pregnancies are common, and only 50 of teenage mothers graduate high school. therefore, parents may feel morally obligated to protect their children from early parenthood.","teenage pregnancies should not be prevented through puritanical methods such as abstinence and isolation. instead, comprehensive sex education and access to contraception and abortion would be more effective."
Attack,"turkey has a strong relationship with the us, one of the most powerful countries in the world.",relations between the us and turkey are deteriorating rapidly.
Support,"mankind is most directly responsible for the elimination of species; therefore, mankind has a moral responsibility to de extinct them.","in the past 500 years , humans have been responsible for over 322 extinct species."
Attack,fair trade helps establish more humane labour norms in the developing world.,there is no guarantee that fair trade will improve working conditions compared to what individuals would have had otherwise.
Attack,"while the conception of god as omnipotent, omniscient and omnibenevolent may be 'traditional' in philosophical discussions of monotheism, it is not necessarily supported by the actual scriptural traditions of abrahamic monotheism.",the bible claims that god is omniscient. psalm 147:5
Support,bars generally hire bouncers to judge who to let in. making assumptions about sexual orientation or gender identity is no different to other commonly used metrics.,gay bars can hire bouncers with strong gaydars to restrict access to cisheterosexuals while still allowing queer patrons into gay bars.
Support,"learning a handful of new, uncomplicated words isn't difficult.","pronouns are almost always 'he', 'she', or 'they', with only rare cases of people using 'ze', 'xe', 've', 'per' ."
Support,"there is no evidence to suggest any particular way for the universe to have began. or that it did not begin. one could suggest this is as far as science can take us. at this point in the discussion humans decide what to believe. even if they choose not to speculate any further, they are making a philisophically heavy decision that is based on something other than falsifiable evidence. for instance, many get to this point and doubt if they ll be content with the decision to not speculate more.",any prolonged discussion on a comprehensive worldview could be suggested as proof that many humans are not satisfied by not speculating beyond what is falsifiable.
Attack,"the green new deal includes implementation of higher taxes and a reduction in tax cuts , which would not be supported by the american population.",most americans support increasing taxes on the wealthy .
Attack,the scrutiny of wealth should be done exclusively by experts.,wealth analysis by experts can be inconsistent and unreliable as their methods can be cherry picked in order to obscure particular interests.
Attack,regulating will undoubtedly increase the amount of hackers and criminal acts to obtain access.,hackers are mostly opportunists who exploit vulnerabilities in a system. many are idologically motivated but not all since hacking is time consuming and expensive. new regulations would therefore only put a penalty on what they are already doing. brute forcing on the other hand requires immense computing power and is only seen by government backed organisations with access to server farms.
Attack,research suggests that sex offender recidivism rates are reduced after psychological interventions.,"predictions of risk from psychologists and psychiatrists are highly speculative and often the tools used over predict risk, often between a third to 50 of the time p. 46 ."
Attack,many teachers regularly use projectors in classrooms to deliver their lessons.,"staring at a projector is much better for the health of students than staring at a mobile phone or tv screen, as projectors emit less blue light."
Support,"plants have many of the qualities generally used to justify granting rights to humans and animals. by this logic, they too should have individual rights.","plants can have memory , develop social structures , walk , eat animals , cry out in pain and even possess some ability to hear ."
Support,"men, even allies, can sometimes make the mistake of fighting sexism on behalf of women, instead of alongside women it is legitimate for feminists to push back against this p. 646 .","some men could be considered a woke misogynist , someone that labels themself a feminist without actually changing any behaviors to support the movement."
Support,"the available and offered alleged evidence for the resurrection of jesus can be better and more simply explained by a confluence of purely natural sociological, historical, cultural, etc. factors.","many people who claim to have undergone an alien abduction claim to have seen what appear to be clones of humans and according to abduction researcher dr. karla turner, abductee pat was shown a jesus imitation by an alien for better compliance and another abductee was shown how a clone of hers was going to work instead of her without anybody noticing. this indicates aliens have the ability to clone humans and to replace them without people noticing which is what could have been done here."
Attack,framing procreation as a right to engage in a fulfilling life experience casts the child as an object to fulfill the desires of the parent.,the feeling of fulfillment associated with having children and the impulse to do so has likely played a large role in the continuation of humanity as a species over the course of history.
Attack,"the eu does not need to bear the full burden, as there are other countries outside the eu who are also making contributions.","most of the commitments are pledges , which have not been fully delivered."
Support,"in secular countries, governments and politicians should try to advocate for their views without relying upon religion.","many religious rules are personal, and can be self imposed. there is no need for them to be expressed in a political manner."
Support,significantly more women than men are graduating from high schools and universities.,"in 2016, 61 of all graduates in the eu of post secondary non tertiary programs were female."
Support,science only truly emerged in more secular and christianity dominated countries.,the scientific revolution occurred in christian countries.
Support,"with the increased popularity of atheism and push for the separation of church and state in the western world, it is not as universally acceptable nowadays to be religious as in the past.",many nations are now moving towards secular majorities. religion is hence rapidly becoming less important even in countries where faith previously affected everything from rulers to borders to architecture.
Attack,"the runoff step may encourage voters to exaggerate support for compromise candidates in an effort to help get them to replace the voter's opposition candidate as one of the runoff candidates ie, 9 6 3 0 9 8 1 0 , making the actual scores less meaningful.",the runoff step is only influenced by the general preference of the voter. ie: changing one's vote from 9 6 3 0 to 9 8 1 0 would change that vote's influence on the score step but not the runoff step.
Support,allowing indians to hold dual citizenship would allow them to be part of the political process.,dual citizenship would allow foreign citizens to be a part of the government . this would be beneficial for indian policymaking as citizens with international expertise and awareness about global best practices would contribute to it.
Support,"after his crucifixion, jesus was buried in a tomb by joseph of arimathea.",jesus burial is attested in the very old tradition quoted by paul in i cor. 15.3 5:
Support,opponents to the government would be seen as on the wrong side of history under such a narrative.,"this may make it harder for opponents to be seen favourably, even if they have good intentions."
Support,the monarch is a permanent diplomatic figure who is respected and appreciated.,the monarch carries out international public visits thus alleviating the elected prime minister or president from these duties and allowing them to run the country more effectively.
Support,"finland is already in the european union and has close relationships with most nato countries, meaning nato membership is not necessary for fostering closer ties.","through the eu's common security and defense policy cesdp , finland is likely sufficiently covered from a military alliance perspective, making joining nato superfluous p. 5 ."
Attack,cultural diversity in the workplace may have a positive influence on the reputation of a company leading to more consumers.,"organisations that prioritise cultural diversity might face an internal backlash from established employees who feel threatened by new hiring practices. this internal backlash can spill out into the open , damaging a company's reputation."
Support,"all animals are fundamentally different from each other, and there's nothing unique about humans that separate them from animals.","most animals share fundamental traits such as having brains, lungs, and senses which allows them to perceive their surroundings."
Support,wrist slashing and hanging are messy and traumatic for relatives and bystanders. legal euthanasia protects them from the shock of discovering a corpse.,traumatic grief can occur from discovering a dead body.
Support,excluding trans women would force them to use men's spaces. this can be detrimental to their health and well being and alarming to men when a person who identifies as a woman enters their space.,trans women allocated to men only prison blocks are at much greater risk of injury or death.
Support,"this gives men a false sense of safety and is irrelevant, as men should still be using condoms.","even if the risk of hiv contraction is lower, there are still plenty of diseases that men should protect themselves of."
Support,just because an event is only mentioned in one source does not mean it is a fabrication.,"the siege of masada is only described in one written source, a passage in josephus."
Attack,"in a 5 4 decision by the supreme court, the court established that providing a forum for speech was not enough to constitute a non profit operating a public access channel, as a state actor and mandate free speech rights.",there was no mention of the internet or social media platforms in any of the legal documents of the case or in questioning posed to the supreme court.
Support,"in the absence of such education, lgbtq youth are disproportionally affected by negative sexual health outcomes .",comprehensive sex education reduces the risk of stis and stds .
Attack,"it's in our nature to struggle: for better or for worse, we always try to exceed our current capabilities. we just shouldn't make struggling harder than it is, especially for the sake of 'essential human experiences'. any struggle that we haven't fixed will allow us to grow, as transhumanism doesn't really take all of that away.","with improvements in technology, what used to be struggle is no longer there. currently, they create or lead to new struggles. however, we could theoretically get to a point where all problems get solutions through technology and no more struggling for existence exists."

Support,it may ease the military tensions between asian countries,"whether asia should form a union similar to the eu is a complex question that depends on various factors. some argue that a unified asian union could promote peace, stability, and economic growth in the region. it could enhance cooperation on issues such as trade, security, and environmental protection. however, others believe that the diversity of cultures, political systems, and economic development levels in asia could make it challenging to create and maintain such a union."
Support,"the present monuments teach an edited version of history, anyone who learns from them is unlikely to be correct.","for example, there are few statues to longstreet, because longstreet turned against the confederacy after the war."
Attack,"there is the same health benefit as with male circumcision, that of enhancing identity and sense of belonging to a family and society.",enhancing identity and sense of belonging to a family and society is not a health benefit but a social benefit.
Attack,excess deaths caused by covid 19 were comparable to those caused by influenza during the severe phases of influenza epidemics.,severe influenza epidemics are outliers and therefore mortality rates from such phases are not indicative of the usual mortality associated with influenza.
Attack,one's awareness of an issue is less important than the actual impact they have on an issue.,educated individuals are more likely to spend money on environmentally friendly products. taking action with their wallets is an effective way to impact societal change and encourage companies to produce more sustainably.
Attack,many public transportation systems are currently inadequate .,"instead of a wholesale ban on cars, city governments should provide incentives to use public transport and create disincentives to own and use private cars."

Attack,captain phasma's character had almost nothing to do in the last jedi and was summarily dispatched.,"captain phasma is a flat character and is only interesting to the plot insofar as she poses as an antagonist to finn's arc. it was appropriate for her character to die at the time, and in the way that she did."
Support,"us law is very clear in defining what a person's reasonable expectation to privacy entails, and has gone to great lengths to protect that right as technology develops. allowing mass data collection via social media and the internet is failing to protect the individual's reasonable expectation to privacy in the 21st century.","in light of the phone surveillance scandal, the intelligence agencies were ordered to cease their collection of the metadata of us citizens' phone calls within 180 days of the freedom act being passed into law."
Support,surveillance balloons can be equipped with high resolution cameras that can capture images and videos of people and activities on the ground.,"some surveillance balloons are already capable of producing images with a resolution of 15 cm from high altitude , and manufacturers expect to further improve these capabilities."
Attack,"very young children naturally use gender labels when they are just learning to speak. this points to early emergence of gender ideas, which may be influenced by children's own biology.","language acquisition and gender socialization are inextricably linked p. 320 . therefore, children s use of gender labels in speech is not indicative of a biological basis, but of the early age from which socialization influences development."
Attack,jesus was not baptized until he was an adult. it makes sense for christians to do the same.,"jesus was baptized by john the baptist , but christian baptism is different from john's baptism ."
Attack,the high costs associated with the mass data collection programmes create an incentive for the intelligence agencies and politicians to justify that expenditure even if it is not efficient because the public could be very unhappy to learn that such spending was wasted rather than redirected into other areas of public spending.,"if high costs are not providing actionable intelligence, there would be strong incentive to pause slow the program, as it is not helping you meet your goals targets."
Support,"the process and aftermath of the existence of our universe show that a causal agent, i.e. god, created it with a will, intellect, and power.","since the universe is finely tuned , it is reasonable to conclude that the cause of the universe is intelligent."
Attack,"even though sweden didn't have any drastic covid 19 measures in place in 2020, the overall death rate was comparable with that of england which had hard lockdowns and other safety measures such as mandatory face masks, etc.","the death rate in sweden seemed to be lower due to many of the most vulnerable individuals, such as care home residents, being vaccinated."
Support,voters rely on mainstream media news corporations for information on political matters.,media corporations use their access and funds to monopolise the coverage of information needed by voters.
Support,equating abortion with murder would cause women to use unsafe methods and put their lives at risk.,abortion is often clandestine and performed in places that do not have sufficient hygiene. this effectively puts the woman's life in danger.
Support,the majority of people in society work for what they have; it is unfair of beggars to ask that these people sacrifice those gains for the beggars' benefit.,"this is particularly true in states with social welfare programs, as the poor are already being provided for by the taxes on the rest of the population."
Support,humans could use the implementation of a global language to construct a better language for everyone.,"esperanto is proof that an efficient, global language can be developed."
Attack,farming vegetarian products also directly or indirectly harms animals in the process of crop production and harvest.,"a study done on how many animals die to produce 1,000,000 calories of a number of different food sources found that for vegetables it is only 2.55 animals, while for beef it is 29 animals and for chicken it is 251.1. this suggests significantly fewer animals are harmed in the production of vegetarian products."
Support,"animals lack dignity, and therefore cannot be degraded.",any dignity that animals do intuitively seem to possess is just humans projecting human concepts onto them. this is the same as the way in which we attribute human characteristics like a desire for revenge to animals even though doing so is unjustified.
Attack,historical accounts of different events in the new testament are often confused to be contradictions.,historical narratives surrounding the tomb of jesus appear to contradict each other.
Support,the existence of more than two genders in numerous cultures disproves the absolute claim that only two genders exist.,the fact that some people identify as gender non binary suggests that the two gender model is imperfect.
Attack,conferring and navigating the legal rights conferred by polygamy to multiple partners vis a vis themselves would be unworkable.,no evidence is presented as to why it would be unworkable. the framework of chains of command works well in the military and could easily apply to legal arrangements for polygamous groups.
Attack,"the at at walkers' tusk guns are mounted on fixed position with the walker only able to bow the head to a certain degree. in practical terms, this means that if a target gets within a certain distance then the walker cannot fire the tusk guns at it. it would have to fire its side guns, yet this would require changing the aim of the at at walker away from the resistance base.","as seen in epv the empire strike back , the minimum range of the at at chin mounted guns is actually extremely close range ."
Support,many members of royal families now have regular jobs.,"queen margrethe ii of denmark is a renowned painter and illustrator whose work has been featured in many publications, like the lord of the rings."

Attack,the fact that the wagner group is a private military group means it is less of a threat to the russian regime.,"as a private military organisation, the wagner group is able to spread and form stations and alliances around the world, making it hard to root out."
Support,protecting and expanding the reproductive health options of women of color is an essential element of promoting racial equity .,studies have shown that maternal health outcomes for african american women remain poor due to systemic racism and disparities in reproductive health access p. 2 .
Support,"traditions aren't always right or worth preserving, especially if they are harmful to the people and society.","providing a 'repository of tradition and continuity' can be undesirable where the state and indeed the monarch has a history of, for example, colonialism and oppression."
Attack,"rather than wasting time on teaching creativity, we should focus on training students in core maths, science, and communication skills.","high level maths, science and communication requires a degree of creativity to mould those skills to the context they're required in; creativity cannot be so easily cast aside."
Attack,democracy as a concept does not necessarily imply direct influence on the legislature process.,rethinking this would favor a more aware population.
Attack,"someone who murders his wife because he caught her cheating is no less guilty of murder than someone who murdered his wife because he hates women. murder is murder, just like mutilation is mutilation.",there are many circumstantial issues such as motive and intention that go into classifying whether a crime is a murder of first degree or manslaughter among others .
Attack,"iran, with which the us has had several diplomatic crises, is incentivized to instigate military conflicts in the region to remove us presence from its vicinity.",iran has shown willingness to negotiate and reach a compromise with the us and its allies.

Attack,the risk of uti in uncircumcised men increase as they get older.,"if a man wishes to get circumcised to prevent future utis, that is perfectly fine. permanent surgical interventions should not be used to prevent minor infections."
Support,"having children is seen as extremely important in us society; therefore, it is likely that minors will consider this when they opt for procedures that could lead to sterilization.","life goals that compete with reproductive capacity, such as a career first mindset, have increased uptake of alternative reproductive methods . thus, transgender minors opting for these procedures would not be out of the ordinary."
Support,"the possibility of facing corporal punishment can instill fear in a child, which may subsequently lead to adverse educational outcomes.","being singled out for punishment can lead to peer stigmatization, harming a student's self esteem and school performance ."
Attack,"laws that target gun ownership risk alienating people with conservative, right wing political views. this contributes to the continued emergence of violent extremists.",right wing extremist groups are declining in numbers .
Support,ancient sources corroborate the idea that jesus died by crucifixion.,the alexamenos graffito corroborates jesus's crucifixion.
Attack,"rights can conflict, which forces an arbitrary choice over which right will take precedence. if morality was objective, this choice would not be necessary.","the requirement that objective morality be self evident assumes that the people under such an objective morality would always adhere to that moral code. that is a self defeating requirement since that assumption would also be objective and therefore self evident. since it is self evident that people don't behave this way, it is therefore self evident that the requirement for self evidence is not true."
Support,"if real estate were returned to the state upon death, people would not invest in it.",it takes most people their entire lives to save up and buy property; most people would only save for this long if their families could benefit from it for a while.
Attack,"schools often have a variety of strategies to help students learning at different speeds, making this only a minor problem.","child geniuses can more easily adapt to homeschool environments, where they can take classes that match their intellectual prowess rather than their age."

Attack,"however difficult it would be to stop a new agi that wants to defeat humanity to control earth's resources, an alien ai that conquered its homeworld and every star between there and here would be many times more powerful.",alien ais would not necessarily have conquered its homeworld and every star between there and here. this is rather unlikely and nothing indicates or substantiates it would be likely.
Attack,"if crop circles are made by extraterrestrials, we have to accept that they are on this planet, and are trying to contact us. if they are here trying to make contact, they are well aware of our technology and our advances in communications, and they would probably use channels that can direct them to scientists and politicians, not farmers.","with today's technology, it is impossible to move in the atmosphere using an aircraft without detection, meaning they cannot be here."
Support,presidential campaigns in the us are outliers compared to the vast majority of elections.,"in germany, political parties release just one 90 second television ad ."
Attack,which religion an individual follows is very highly correlated with the community in which one is raised. converts are outliers.,"in the year 100 there were 360 non christians for every evangelical christian. by the year 1000, there were 220 non christians for every evangelical. by the year 1900, there were only 27 non christians per evangelical. by 1950 that number had shrunk to 21 non christians per evangelical christian. and in the year 2000 there were 7 non christians for every evangelical believer in the world."
Attack,"science is guilty of perpetuating the same oppressive ideologies, such as sexism and racism, that are prevalent in society. thus, scientific conclusions appear to be tainted by bias and prejudice, much like any other way of knowing and understanding reality.",the scientific method is not designed to perpetuate any ideology.
Support,"the concept of a mahram exists to protect women from the dangers of society , rather than to impose a discriminatory code onto them.","in over 90 of sexual assaults , the victims are women."
Support,there is no guarantee that changing our lifestyles now will result in a better quality of life for people in the future.,the devastating impacts of climate change are now unavoidable . individual lifestyle changes will not make any difference at this point.
Support,many deeply devout people often question their faith. the fact that mother teresa experienced doubts is often used to provide comfort and guidance to those experiencing similar doubts.,"experiencing and overcoming moments of theological doubt is a core aspect of the experience of catholicism. jesus himself cried out on the cross, asking god why he had forsaken him."
Support,cultural components change over time: cultural transformation is a natural dynamic process.,"humans' meat consumption patterns today are not the same as those of their stone age ancestors. naturally, the kind of hunting and consumption of meat practised by stone age humanoids does not, therefore, hold the same importance in modern day culture."
Support,"on many mediums, loose regulations mean adverts can be intentionally misleading and sensationalizing.","they also play deceiving word games, such as products that say made with natural ingredients , when actually saying includes 2 of natural ingredients would be more accurate."
Support,not all costs of the bailout were directly borne by the us government; some were offset through directed mergers and liquidations.,"to bail out its depositors and shareholders, the us federal reserve orchestrated the sale of bear stearns , a major investment bank, to jp morgan in 2008 p. 514 ."
Support,"the institution of marriage, be it a love marriage or an arranged marriage, is inherently misogynistic and sexist .","in any kind of marriage, it is tradition for the groom to be to ask the bride to be's father for permission to marry her. this perpetuates the historical notion that women are the property of men."
Attack,there are significant examples of direct democracy violating the rights of minorities.,this seems more like an argument for educating individuals on identity politics rather than attacking direct democracy. there is nothing inherently discriminatory about direct democracy in and of itself
Support,negative externalities must be contained as they impose negative effects on unrelated third parties.,"uncontrolled air, water or noise pollution from industry has a negative impact on large parts of the population and on the environment."

Attack,"it is bad science if the falsification of a hypothesis is being brushed off, with two simplistic generalising counterclaims which do not offer falsifiability.","the no true scotsman fallacy is a logical claim, not a scientific hypothesis."
Support,self paced degrees can slow down the learning process.,"if self paced degrees take longer to complete, students of these degrees may fall behind in comparison to their peers who are on campus college students."
Attack,"hegemonic masculinity legitimizes men's dominant position under patriarchy and justifies the subordination of women, transgender people, and men who perform non normative masculinities.",the concept of hegemonic masculinity as a fixed practice has been criticized for excluding the complexity of different and competing forms of masculinity p. 836 .

Support,"the solution to this problem should not be to restrict speech, but rather to invest more in media literacy training in schools.",there exist many resources for teaching media literacy as some schools around the world do already. expanding access to media literacy would not be difficult.
Attack,"for example, removing someone from life support even though they have actively indicated that they want to keep life support is grossly immoral, since they have actively withdrawn their consent. but if someone is in terrible pain, and is not in a fit state of mind to understand what is going on, it might be moral to remove them from life support even though they cannot actively consent.",there is a large ethical difference between keeping someone alive via life support and performing cosmetic surgery on an infant. this claim is a strawman fallacy.
Support,"for parents who work, aligning the school day with the beginning of their working day reduces childcare costs.",sleep cycles develop over time . it is important to develop helpful habits.
Support,the history of science shows that scientists have their own biases.,"as kuhn suggests in his classic text, the structure of scientific revolutions 1962 , scientific inquiries should involve external factors, such as social, political and cultural influences in the development of scientific paradigm."
Attack,that paul described the changing of the perishable into the unperishable doesn't disprove the physical resurrection. instead what is implied is a changing of the quality of the physical body.,"what paul described is not a modification or change in quality of the physical body. rather, it is the replacement of the body with a wholly new and different body."
Attack,russia has said it would interpret the alliance s expansion as a direct threat .,russia should not be allowed to dictate the defense policies of other countries.
Attack,"learning to code in school can rather stifle rather than facilitate and support interest in and skills for software development. it can be boring, inefficient, outdated , have little relation to actual coding practices, and be perceived as a compulsory difficult burden.","some languages, such as c, html, and python rarely change, so the code designed by someone 30 years ago can work just the same now albeit faster when considering moore's law , therefore these may act as beneficial starter languages."
Support,"humanity would likely create multiple ai systems, which could likely keep each other in check.","if multiple agis that operate in different ways are in existence, it is unlikely that they would all go rogue together."
Support,"libet's findings are based on an interpretation of brain activity that has been debunked , undermining conclusions that are drawn from them about free will.","researchers have cautioned against drawing conclusions about free will based on libet's findings, which are based on the notion of bereitschaftspotential bp or readiness potential."

Support,"gender neutral bathrooms may make individuals more vulnerable to rapists, abusers, or stalkers.","government must keep people safe in order to legitimise the trade offs people make to support the state. allowing crime to increase due to the standardisation of gender neutral bathrooms would, therefore, be illegitimate."
Support,that men should be punished or attacked is a view espoused by many leading feminists.,"any man will follow any feminine looking thing down any dark alley; i've always wanted to see a man beaten to a shit bloody pulp with a high heeled shoe stuffed up his mouth, sort of the pig with the apple; it would be good to put him on a serving plate but you'd need good silver. mercy: a novel, andrea dworkin."
Attack,deregulation has caused havoc in a number of industries and countries around the world.,"the telecommunications industry boomed following deregulation, with stiff competition among mobile phone service providers driving down the cost for consumers."

Attack,"in the name of protecting marginalized groups, political correctness propagates myths and untruths.",political correctness can't spread any lies since it is about using non offensive terminology or behaviour.
Attack,"the economic activities of high income countries have contributed massively to climate change, which creates an obligation for them to make reparations for the increased number of climate linked humanitarian disasters that can trigger refugee crises p. 206 .","china, whose income per capita is only a quarter that of high income countries, is the world's leading contributor to climate change, with annual co2 emissions double those of the next highest contributor."
Support,this would be a senseless strategic move: trump would retain more power if he remained president.,"it would also be unjust: if mass voter fraud truly did happen, trump would have an obligation to oppose it."
Attack,it does not demonstrate significant changes in body plan and function.,"evolution predicts we will rarely, if ever, see significant changes in body plan and function; for instance, that all vertebrates have four limbs is evidence of their common descent."

Attack,"the gospel accounts describe the behaviour of the apostles after the crucifixion in an unflattering but very human light. peter denys christ three times, thomas basically doesnt believe a bloody word of it. they describe running to the tomb and who went in first. they don't go on about theology. this seems like confused eyewitness accounts not fabrication",it is likely a combination of real events and fabricated elements.
Support,"political correctness encourages civility in society, and as such enables discourse.",agreeing to pc ascription of labels is a way of defining society as tolerant and accepting.
Attack,students who have variable interest rates against their loans might be forced to pay higher interest rates in the future.,those who have variable interest rates on their loans can look into refinancing options if their interest rates rise in future.

Support,the status quo has resulted in at least three wars fought in palestine within the last decade alone. they resulted in the deaths of thousands of civilians and destruction of significant amounts of critical infrastructure.,the lack of progress in the conflict between israel and palestine could cause a third intifada as people are increasingly frustrated with the status quo.
Attack,"the church supported the work of nicolaus copernicus 1473 1543 , whose heliocentric model of the solar system was published with the church's permission. also, georges lemaître 1894 1966 , a catholic priest, proposed the big bang theory, which became a cornerstone of modern cosmology","giving somebody permission to publish and not suppressing or opposing something is not to be equated with the catholic religion being responsible for piloting scientific progress being responsible for something in this sense means to be a driver, major supporter or the organization behind the particular progress."

Attack,"domination of other species is a perfectly natural result of interspecific competition . human supremacy, by design, is self preservation that is unconcerned with the tertiary effects on other species.",human efforts to protect non human biological life on earth is evidence to the contrary; humanity has a collective desire and responsibility to protect sentient animal life on earth.
Attack,"the main reason why we might want to assign 50 probability to a yes or no hypothesis is the principle of indifference , and this same principle tells us to assign a 5 probability to the result of a d20.","it tells us to assign a 5 probability only after concluding that there are 20 outcomes, which comes from the aforementioned knowledge and principles. before that, we only know of two outcomes: the dice will land on 11 and the dice will not land on 11 ."
Attack,current proven reserves of fissile uranium will last for 200 years at current rates of consumption . the required expansion to replace fossil fuels could improve the amount of time by an order of a magnitude.,"renewable sources like wind and solar have the potential to last indefinitely, which makes them more compelling from a sustainability standpoint."

Support,"even if families with certain religious or traditional values are against teaching gender identity and sexual orientation in school, such an education should most definitely be taught because of its benefits to children.","as children get older, they have a right to be exposed to viewpoints beyond those of their parents, and school is designed to be one of the key arenas for that process."
Attack,"many nuclear power plants are located next to rivers, lakes, and seas and use water as a coolant, which in turn, heats the water. when the water with the elevated temperature is returned to the body of water, the local ecosystems are destroyed.",commercial reactors that use cooling towers extract water from the environment and evaporate it to steam in a phase change heat sink. thermal energy from the reactor is never transferred to nearby water bodies.

Attack,physical reading of the brain can retrieve images from human memory. ibtimes.co.uk,"using the word retrieve to represent this study is misleading. subjects were shown 300 images of faces which created brain activity that was then captured and mapped. when a subject was shown a new photo, the researchers were able to construct an image similar to what was being shown. at most this demonstrates that the same regions of the brain are used for visual query. no retrieval occurred. moreover, the linked source doesn t make it clear if there was consistent mapping subject to subject."
Attack,a prisoner's input is not and should not be considered relevant to the punishment they are given.,"insofar as the criminal justice system seeks to alter behaviour, the perceptions and reactions of those who interact with it are relevant."

Support,economic liberalisation benefits developing nations.,economic liberalisation increases job opportunities for people in developing nations.
Support,"if there were no borders, it would be much harder to track and catch criminals or suspects as they moved across them.","the unodc identified border control as crucial to controlling smuggling, and drafted strategies on how to best perfect said controls."

Attack,"animals do in fact have rights. many forms of cruelty are explicitly outlawed. one cannot, for instance, torture a dog for years in their basement. therefore the statement that animals do not have rights is fundamentally false.","the original statement this is responding to was indicating that animals lack rights . that is not false. we do not live in a completely free society, and there are rules and laws which permit and prohibit certain behaviors. animals are lacking certain rights in that humans are given rights which animals are not, such as a dog cannot walk unleashed in public areas. contrarily people lack certain rights which animals have, such as dogs being able to defecate in public."
Support,"this argument is a double edged sword. if the boycott signifies that muslims will not allow their lives to be interfered with, then any retaliatory measure from the french government and people should be taken as a message that they will not allow their french way of life to be interfered with.",this sentiment underlay the je suis charlie and je suis samuel rallies.
Support,privatization of the nhs is likely to increase patient choice.,research on hospitals in greece suggests that privatisation of selected public services can increase patients' freedom of choice and also improve efficiency and quality of services.
Attack,"many lgbtq individuals face discrimination , harassment, and violence in their daily lives, so they should be able to self segregate into exclusive safe spaces.",permitting cisgender heterosexual persons to enter lgbtq spaces does not mean these spaces are no longer safe.
Support,"if it is deemed necessary or appropriate for government to support small businesses, it should do so with direct grants or loans, not through the income tax system.","giving back door support to small businesses or any enterprise through tax reductions opens the door to abuse. taxes and incentives should be unrelated measures so they can be examined, evaluated and implemented independently."
Attack,countries with big welfare states have less poverty.,"this is putting the cart before the horse. wealthy countries can afford a big welfare state, at least for a few generations, while poor countries cannot. in order to be able to redistribute purchasing power, there have to be people creating massive surpluses that can be taken away and redistributed."
Support,"less than 2 of the population is intersex. this figure is too small to warrant a change in how sex is conceptualized and classified, when its established definition adequately accommodates 98 of the population.","biological males and females are not only a majority but also relatively homogeneous in their sexual characteristics. in contrast, intersex individuals are significantly heterogeneous ; this limits the practical utility of such a category."
Attack,a life must never be taken where it is within ones power to keep it.,"many countries have capital punishment laws in place, which suggests that under certain conditions, the right to life can rightfully be taken away."
Support,"there is no evidence that fate is real, nor that there is a higher being.",the laws of quantum entanglement would suggest that there is no such thing as pre destined fate.

Support,social media sites facilitate the promotion of disordered eating.,"celebrities frequently advertise weight loss products on social media, like teas, shakes, appetite suppressing lollipops and diet pills."
Attack,"many people believe that some dog breeds are naturally more aggressive than others, and subsequently need a stronger hand to keep them under control.","research has shown that aggressive behavior can predicted by looking at the owner, rather than the dog. in other words, the way a person trains a dog says more about that dog's potential aggressive behavior that its breed."
Attack,"the input of elder external parties brings a wealth of diverse past experiences to the decision making process, which may be highly beneficial when finding and choosing a suitable marital partner.","intergenerational cultural dissonance means that the opinions and insights of elders may be completely at odds with the preferences of those entering into an arranged marriage. in such cases, the input of the former can cause conflict and confusion in the latter's search for a suitable life partner."
Attack,the content created by vulnerable communities exposes them to internet trolls who target such people.,"individuals from marginalized communities face risks when challenging the prevailing views of the dominant majority, but engaging in such opposition online provides them with support and a measure of safety from physical attacks."
Attack,it takes more effort to be environmentally conscious.,being environmentally conscious has been made easier by public and corporate policies.
Attack,"in order for objective morality to exist, there must be objectively true or false moral propositions. the proposition of the existence of morality is such a statement regardless of the correct answer, and so objective morality necessarily and self evidently exists.",no objective morality exists is not a moral claim but a metaethical claim.
Support,excluding trans women would force them to use men's spaces. this can be detrimental to their health and well being and alarming to men when a person who identifies as a woman enters their space.,"transitioning socially, as well as medically, greatly reduces symptoms of dysphoria , especially in adolescents."
Support,statements of belief of feminists specifically include equality as a foundational principle.,first wave feminists espoused beliefs in equality.
Attack,healthcare is a human right and government should do everything in their power for the realisation of that right.,healthcare is a scarce resource . a right implies that everyone should have access to it. that is not compatible with the notion of scarcity.

Support,"cities without private cars would be safer, as cars injure, disable, and kill an inordinate number of people each year.",private cars are dangerous due to the limitations of individual drivers.
Support,if people were more aware of the magnitude of inequality they would want the government to act to reduce it. us citizens believe that wealth distribution in the us is far more equal than it actually is.,"when given a blind choice between the distribution of wealth of the usa and the far more equal distribution of sweden, 98 of americans surveyed preferred the swedish distribution."
Support,"post hoc ergo proter hoc. it is a common phenomenon that a large common transportation, linguistic and judicial medium coupled with a grade of cultural tolerance as it was during the first centuries of islam allows for a rapid spread of ideas and thus a boost in arts, sciences and technology.","macedonian conquests and forming of hellenic states had nothing to do with the spread of a religion, yet the medium they've created allowed for the most spectacular bloom of science, art and technology before the early modern era."
Support,civilian casualties and the presence of western troops leads to the radicalisation of afghans and observers from other nations.,us presence in afghanistan has led to an increase in the activity of the taliban in pakistan .
Attack,"ring vaccination, whereby only those known to have a disease and their contacts, is highly effective.",ring vaccination will not work for a disease that is very widespread . universal vaccination for smallpox was recommended until the case rate worldwide was restricted to a few geographic areas.

Attack,"in the late 1980s, gender reassignment surgery was legalized in sharia and state law in iran and egypt p. 91 . this shows an expansion in the scope of islamic tolerance towards transgender muslims.","despite their legalization of gender reassignment surgery, iran does not recognize non binary individuals and would rather have people go under a surgeon's knife than accept the non binary nature of gender ."
Support,"even profound changes to the climate will not negatively impact the natural world as a whole, which has persisted through massive changes to the climate and ecosystems.","the earth's climate is well within the bounds of the current holocene , a period during which humans have thrived . though the climate may be changing, it isn't necessarily bad, as the earth will survive irrespective of shifts in the climate."
Attack,"men, by virtue of their heavier participation in political life, have done more evil than women.",women were not permitted to hold positions of influence when most evils took place. this does not mean they would not commit evil.

Attack,"if you are not familiar with the latest global zeitgeist , other people's reactions to your statements should point you in the right direction. from there, it takes five minutes of google, which is not asking a lot.","this assumes all this is even a good idea in the first place and further, that once decoded it will be seen to be true. neither proposition is universally accepted. pc culture has taken on ideas and language that, though they may contain seeds of compassion and truth, are opaque to many and worse, disguise many controversial ideas not accepted by science, philosophy or even within it's own cultural milieu."
Support,"many students have to work while they're studying as part of their loan package, which reduces their chances of successfully graduating.",only 30 of americans who enroll in university successfully graduate.
Support,"matthew 5:28 is commonly used to support a blanket prohibition on lusting, but it is likely that the greek word gynaika in this context is better translated as wife than women. this is important because if it were true, the verse would only condemn lusting after other people's wives, not unmarried women assuming the luster is unmarried themselves .","the type of lusting in this verse is called adultery, which is the biblical term for sex with someone else's spouse. if this was meant to condemn sexual desire between unmarried people it is more likely a different, more general word would have been used."

Attack,the average person may not be easily convinced that a pseudo random number generator is not rigged.,"pseudo random number generators don't have to be complicated. if everyone's commitment values were large enough, a really simple pseudo random number generator could just equate to adding up all of the committed values after they have been revealed. i'm sure every voter at least understands addition. if a simple prng is used, the complicated part of the random number generation process that many voters may not understand, wouldn't be the prng, but rather the commitment scheme seeding it."
Support,"the framework view is a viable interpretation which posits that genesis explains god s creation topically, not chronologically.","the framework view posits that the days are not chronological, but are logically arranged into two triads . in the first triad, god prepares creaturely kingdoms and in the second, he fills them with various creatures."
Support,"empathy and sympathy, from which moral truths derive, are common features of human cultures and belief systems.","there are aspects of morality that can be objectively defined. morality is determined by logical reasoning and empathy, rather than arbitrary rules. it is something that must be philosophically explored in order to understand it with certainty. similar to how philosophy can be used to understand the truth about nature science , and the truth about truth logic , the truth about morality can be figured out through study, argument and thought."
Support,"governments have an incentive to ensure that teachers are well trained , as poor education practices weaken the skills of the future workforce .","some nations, such as singapore, promote mastery in particular subjects. the success of such efforts has led to their wider adoption , demonstrating the drive to improve mandatory schooling."
Attack,this planet may well be unable to support human life long enough for babies born post 2010 to live until an old age. the decision to bring more people onto the planet is short sighted and selfish.,it is possible that humans may become an extra terrestrial species within the lifetime of a child born today. the survival of this planet is not required for children born today to reach old age.

Support,"as much of society's base productivity becomes automated , ubi will ensure that everyone can enjoy the benefits.","as automation frees human beings from the need to work as much, a humanist approach would be to equitably distribute the automated wealth, allowing people to pursue self actualization and societal progress on a scale that was previously inconceivable."

Attack,bartholomew was not mentioned in the book of acts. yet we have good reason to believe he did extensive work in taking the gospel to india.,there is significant extra biblical evidence for bartholomew and his activities. this serves to justify believing he played important roles in spreading christianity after jesus died. there is no such analogous evidence for either nicodemus or joseph of arimathea.
Attack,the right to privacy has been used to create a constitutional right to abortion in many jurisdictions.,the natural right to privacy is not necessarily unique to women.
Support,"distinguishing between sex and gender identity is a recent advancement . thus, past generations may not have had access to the vocabulary they needed to articulate any perceived discrepancy between their experience of gender and their assigned sex.","being transgender was considered a mental disorder by the who up until 2019. thus, even those who may have experienced dysphoria may not have felt comfortable identifying as trans."
Support,an existence with some suffering may be preferable to never having existed.,"humans who live with disabilities after an accident often say they are happy to be alive, rather than wishing they were dead."

Support,"subconsciously, our brains are always aware of our surroundings , and can draw comparisons and make associations without our active input.","this subconscious activity can cause children to associate the religious symbols they see with either positive or negative experiences, depending on their relationship with the teacher, school, and classroom."
Attack,"in many countries, attending college is associated with high levels of alcohol consumption . having more students in this kind of environment can lead to higher levels of alcohol abuse.","this can be solved by better alcohol related policies and behavior, not by limiting access to higher education."
Attack,men's bathroom queues are often shorter because using urinals is more time efficient; forcing men to use stalls could slow them down.,"it is unfair to penalize women with longer bathroom wait times because urinals were not designed with them in mind. therefore, people of all genders should wait in the same queue to use a bathroom."
Support,israel has a deplorable track record on human rights.,israel practically operates the largest open air prison in the world in gaza.
Support,there is research and development of llm vulnerabilities. having it be open source helps develop such understanding as well as application of it whenever understanding or capacities have improved.,having it open source enables more and better testing of hypotheses for mitigating well known vulnerabilities .

Support,pixel games usually have a game style that would just feel wrong with realistic graphics.,the title 'fez' is inherently reliant on the medium of pixel art to visualize its environment. to separate the visual medium from the game itself would essentially sever its stylistic charm and only damage its mechanics.
Attack,"it's immoral to allow others to suffer if they have chosen not to purchase healthcare coverage in advance and have a need, so healthcare coverage must be mandatory.","the government does and should allow people to make other decisions that damage our health. examples include smoking cigarettes, drinking alcohol excessively, not working out everyday, eating unhealthy diets, spending too much time on social media, not getting enough sleep etc."
Support,a global language would not succeed due to practical limitations involving the inherent nature of language.,"words cannot translate perfectly across different populations, due to diversity of lived experience and lexical needs."
Support,"rights natural or constructed are frequently violated and go unenforced. but this does not intuitively mean people don't have the rights in question. therefore, enforcement of a right is not an indicator of its existence.","in some countries, as little as 1 of reported rapes lead to conviction. this means that in effect the right not to be raped is largely unenforced. but the overwhelming majority of people would still say that there is a right not be raped, be that natural or constructed."
Attack,"this claim argues that evil is compatible with god because evil is limited in scope. but if god was loving, all knowing, and powerful, even limited, finite evil would be an anathema.","to simply assert that an omniscient, omnipotent and omnibenevolent god would consider evil anathema begs the question. the assertion assumes without argument or evidence that such a god could have no good reason for allowing temporary evil."
Attack,"biden could step down or be impeached , allowing harris to become president by default.",biden has announced he will run for president in 2024. this suggests that he is not interested in stepping down.
Attack,"christianity encourages evangelism to spread the word of god, including missionaries who travel and live amongst non believer populations.","to evangelize a population is not the same as to co exist with them if the evangelizers are actively trying to change the population, in this case lgbtq people, into being something else, in this case, e.g., either straight or celibates who deny their sexuality. to evangelize gay people without trying to change them could be co existence."

Attack,"the notes students take with laptops are worse than those they write by hand as they tend to transcribe lectures verbatim instead of processing them. consequently, this hurts their learning mueller oppenheimer, p. 1159 .","as critics of this argument point out, different students may have different styles of note taking and learning. laptops allow those who prefer verbatim notes to effectively take them during class murray, p. 202 ."
Support,"the god hypothesis is not equally good at explaining everything. however, there are some things that require explanation to which god is the best explanation.","god is the best explanation for the existence of objective moral values and duties. given that there are multiple postulated explanations for the existence of objective morals necessity, biological evolution, deontic objectivity, whatever contributes to human flourishing , it is far from apparent that the existence of objective moral values and duties is a brute fact without explanation . therefore, god can be an explanation for morality."
Support,there are other ways to improve relations outside of attending pride.,community meetings between law enforcement and representative members of the lgbtq community is an option.
Support,"a maximum of personal freedom is not possible, because it always comes at the cost of restricting another person's freedom.","there are spaces such as courtrooms where speaking out of turn can land one in prison, yet this is not regarded as a limitation of freedom of speech."

Attack,"humans restrict the freedom and autonomy of countless of living organisms for their entire lives and the lives of generations to come, including other humans.","the principle of autonomy does not apply to any other living organisms besides humans, as humans are the only agents aware of or capable benefitting from an abstract principle like automony."
Attack,genetically modified people not to feel pain wouldn't make killing people ok. it should not be different for animals.,"often, persons sentenced to the death penalty are given anesthetic drugs before being killed. one could argue that this shows that some humans approve of taking human life when the person being killed feels no pain."
Support,the death penalty is an extremely effective deterrent because humans value their own lives and fear death above anything else.,any contemporary lack of deterrence is often a result of offenders not understanding how authorities may catch them. online deterrence campaigns can rectify this and reduce offences.
Attack,if one could prevent people from building bombs that autonomously blow themselves up then that would be also important and it's unclear if that's more important than technicalities of how to prevent that given the hypothetical state that this feature has been built in.,"the claim is making a point is about how an analogy between nuclear bombs and ai fails, not actually asserting that there is a risk of agentic nuclear bombs autonomously starting ww3."
Attack,"hardly anyone is very consistently open minded and critical, and we don't know how to make them that way expecting a class in epistemology to achieve such results is hopelessly optimistic.",a method to make people very consistently open minded and critical can be derived from things that are commonly known.

Attack,"in 2014, 20 million women required access to publicly funded contraception such as that provided by planned parenthood due to poverty, low income, or being under 20 years old.",the public should not be forced to pay for contraception for low income individuals.
Support,"the deterrence provided by corporal punishment results in student compliance and discipline, which provides a conducive environment for teachers to operate.","the fear of being punished would prevent students from disrupting classes and disobeying rules, which would make the teachers' work more difficult."

Support,meditation has been proven to encourage and develop concentration .,our minds tend to be lost in thoughts 47 of the time which can provoke negative emotions such as anxiety and stress. mediation is an efficient tool to become more focused.

Support,"qur anic interpretation has historically been biased by islam's patriarchal cultural context, which has resulted in readings that marginalize and oppress women p. 30 . there are other, less biased, ways of interpreting the qur'an.","organizations such as sisters in islam believe that islam , from its outset, was a liberating religion that uplifted the status of women and gave them revolutionary rights, and that repressive interpretations of the qur'an are mostly influenced by cultural practices and values p. 58 ."
Attack,recognising palestine as a legitimate state may jeopardise israel's place in the region.,violence against israel is often motivated by the occupation of palestine. treating palestine as a legitimate state and removing israeli troops from the region could bring peace.
Attack,"due to poor voter turnout , politicians often have only received votes from large minorities of the population. therefore politicians do not have the widespread support and trust of the population.","many people do not or cannot vote for reasons other than a lack of trust. people may have work commitments, may lack transportation, or may have access issues."
Attack,"the existence of divine beings cannot be proved or disproved. therefore, this claim is unsupported.","absolutely nothing in the world outside of our own minds can be proved or disproved in a truly complete sense. to live in a world, we must admit a lower threshold than this to admit that something exists or does not exist."
Attack,"talking about changing the orientation of socioeconomics does not imply a smooth transition or small scale trials. these are excuses and distractions that were not present in the argument to begin with, and cannot be said to be what the argument is about .",starting to conduct small scale trials is one this this branch is all about and those are also possible and the lack thereof is one reason why this cause area is neglected and pressing.
Support,"the young adult literature industry is worth nearly 20 billion , and the books created by the industry are designed to appeal directly to young adult consumers. this can lead to negative educational effects.","sex sells. however publishers, do not have an interest in providing healthy or educational perspectives of sex. this is particularly salient when considering the context of vulnerable and impressionable young adults."
Attack,"if one person is more dependent than the other, this might introduce a power imbalance to the relationship.",power imbalances can be applicable to romantic relationships too.
Attack,"sex hormones are not distributed equally ; men have more testosterone and women have more estrogen, so the relative concentration of sex hormones is associated with gender.","though exposure to more prenatal male hormones may influence girls to have more traditionally masculine interests , it does not affect their gender identity."
Attack,obesity can have serious negative impacts on people's physical and mental wellbeing.,society's condemnation of obesity causes a significant portion of the lower well being of obese people.
Attack,it s not always clear that publicly stated goals of political organizations are convincing on their own. the statements of purpose are only believable only if the approach is sound and the organization not prone to deceive others.,"no evidence has been provided that any of the feminist organizations are prone to deceiving others, so even with the claim above, it s best to believe the organization's stated goals."
Attack,"substantial power inevitably leads to corruption and the rise of tyrants, such as stalin or mao .",the same can be said of capitalists who grow exceptionally powerful.
Support,"homeschooled families are generally closer because the parents tend to share core beliefs and a feeling of persecution . as a result, studies on their closeness say little about the effect of homeschooling itself.",this extreme approach to ideological or religious beliefs allows families to silo themselves within religious or political echo chambers. this can breed dysfunction p. 5 .
Attack,as the understanding of what is good or bad art depends on the sensorial perception of each viewer. ai is already superior because it can analyze the historical relation of cause and effect specific to each person to provide a customizable art experience.,there is an assumption that art trends are predictable through algorithms. we cannot even perfectly predict the weather.

Support,alternatives to fluoridated water and promoting proper dental hygiene are more efficient in preventing tooth decay.,"silica, one of the most prominent natural chemical compounds on earth, also prevents tooth decay , and has not been shown to be harmful like fluoride."
Attack,"public funding of elections for state legislatures in the united states pushed candidates from both parties further away from the centre, making them less likely to be able to compromise with one another.",subsequent research has found that there is no impact of public funding on political polarisation of state legislatures.
Attack,"the urbanization of barren desert prevents the uae from being able to sustain itself within the regional natural water cycle . as such, it is overpopulated and must use work arounds to continue existing.","running out of water in the desert does not equate to the uae being overpopulated, rather that it was a foolish idea to unsustainably build so many population centers in the desert."

Support,medical professionals will often be forced to violate their individual code of ethics in order to administer or supervise the death penalty.,it is not ethical to make another human being carry the weight of killing someone.
Attack,"for many, the choice to give is not voluntary. instead, they give due to the shame they would feel if they did not give.",this shame is not a coercive force the donation remains entirely voluntary.
Support,it is easier to make language technology available and potentially free than it is to adopt a universal language.,"most modern communication occurs on the internet, where physical distances don't matter and the only thing stopping communication is language."
Support,it does not necessarily have to be put in a negative light . the statement or action just has to be perceived as offensive.,"the term microaggression captures this idea. this concept makes it possible to say something in good faith, with no bad intent, but still be perceived as aggressive or offensive. the standard for offense is not external and societal, but could conceivably exist at the individual level."
Attack,the potentially abusive enforcement of free speech restrictions by ruling parties is irrelevant if their actions are accountable to mediating institutions.,media outlets may not hold the government accountable for abuse if they fear for their own free speech rights. p. 51
Attack,"the fact that other future risks are also in the future and not the present, does not refute the fact that dismissing future risk from ai on the basis that ai is presently a mere tool is invalid.",the claim that is disputing did not state that or the equivalent of that.
Support,many of the statistics on divorce rates among religious couples are flawed for a number of reasons.,"the statistics overlook that many catholics seek an annulment , which is another way of ending a marriage."
Attack,the accumulation of wealth is harmful to the economy.,the accumulation of wealth allows people to make large investments which helps the economy.
Attack,"in 2019 , amazon paid 162 million in federal income taxes.","the federal income tax paid by amazon in 2019 represents a very small proportion of its pre tax income, roughly 1.2 . in contrast, the federal corporate tax rate in the us is 21 ."
Attack,there is very little regulation to protect women in the sex industry.,"in germany , prostitution is a business like any other, including social insurance, taxes, and hygiene regulations."
Attack,"migration would decrease the pressure on the affected nations, which allow the nations to allocate more resources towards rebuilding.","the number of affected people is a consideration made in the allocation of support funds. therefore, mass migration might result in less funds to recovery efforts."
Attack,"other behaviours or strategies may be more beneficial than meditation, produce the same effects with more efficiency, or less drawbacks.","if you need to feed your dog, you can't meditate your dog some food. if you want to calm your mind or deepen spiritual practice, meditation is unbeat."
Attack,fortunately those horrible things where not done according to catholic teachings,the inquisition was an influential institution established within the catholic church to identify and penalize heresy across europe and the americas.
Support,"sexual arousal isn't solely dependent on culture and socialisation. there is a large innate and genetic component. therefore, cultural changes can't fully desexualise bodies.","male animals are often visibly aroused by females even during non sexual encounters. public nudity, then, would not desexualize the human body."
Support,any problems that arise from having mixed gender troops can be mitigated by having gender segregated units.,gender segregated units are not uncommon and have been used successfully in norway .
Attack,immersive fitness games use the motion capture technology of the xbox one kinect and the playstation move to motivate players to remain active while playing.,the xbox one kinect and its fitness program were shut down in 2017 and are not compatible with newer xbox consoles.
Support,"widespread societal agreement about obesity's unacceptability can help support policy changes that may prevent obesity, like scheduling more time for physical education in schools or taxing sugary drinks.","many people who are currently obese would prefer not to be, but lack the resources and support to lose weight. this suggests they recognise their condition as detrimental to their wellbeing."
Support,abraham lincoln made great effort before the war to prevent the southern states from seceding and preserve the union.,lincoln's first inaugural address emphasized the need to compromise in order to preserve the union .
Support,russia has attacked the west by invading ukraine .,"russia has captured ukrainian territory , expanding their control west."
Support,hundreds of deaths each year are linked to vaccines.,"if there is any possibility of something resulting in death, then it should not be the place of the government to force people to do it. individuals should be able to consider the risks and decide for themselves."
Attack,"poor regions, countries, and organizations lag behind their wealthier counterparts in scientific output.","low scientific output is a reason to remove barriers such as paywalls, not to maintain them."
Attack,water is merely symbolic as a purifying agent. the use of water in baptism isn't necessary for anyone.,acts 10:47 explicitly mentions water in the context of christian baptism.
Support,donald trump's impressive net worth is evidence of his business skill.,"between may 31, 2018, and july 16, 2018, trump was able to raise his net worth from 2.48 billion to 3.8 billion ."
Support,the eu's response is not proportional to its responsibility to syria and turkey.,the eu benefits from trade with syria and turkey; therefore it has a greater responsibility towards them.
Attack,"even if true, if it were easier to solve ai x risk than to solve pandemics and nuclear war, that would not refute 'should be a global priority alongside' pandemics and nuclear war; if it's more tractable , it might even merit a higher priority to work on, because such work is more cost effective.",this is the case only if one makes the following assumptions: 1. pandemics and nuclear war already are an actual global priority 2. the current level of work and global priority of ai x risk isn't already sufficient for the time being only so much can be done so long in advance . both assumptions are false.
Attack,the public knowledge of everyone's income information will have a negative effect on the wider economy.,"wealth transparency would enable taxation of wealth, rather than income, increasing revenues for the government."
Attack,"women have been to space , mount everest , the north and south pole and complete the hardest sport events.",they have yet to become as successful as men in doing so.
Attack,science has been described as self correcting . the same can hardly be said about religion.,there are numerous examples of religion self correcting and changing its stance on issues.
Support,the qur'an teaches that both men and women were created from a single soul ; muslim scholars interpret this as supporting the inherent equality of the sexes and favor the ranking of humans based only on their moral worth.,"islam condemned and put an end to female infanticide , which was widely prevalent in pre islamic arabia."
Attack,"people should not be valued only for their utility but instead they should be valued simply because they are human. people shouldn't be used as means to an end, even if it is purportedly for the greater good.","if using people to achieve a greater good achieves better ends than always treating people as ends in themselves does, then one should use people as a means to an end when necessary."
Support,"states do not know better than religious doctrine, in terms of what is the correct practice for a religion.","states in their current form are relatively new and have not existed for most of time. religion has a long history, often based in what is believed to be the word of god."
Attack,"by making this, there are both possibilities to make a movie success or a failure and another procedural problems , but it seems like most people like a movie being similar to the comic version, like in the anime audience.","lately, mcu movies have had more success in the box office even if they are quite far from comics or completely different in comparison with the dc universe. this suggests that people don't mind similarities with comics, they just like cool movies."
Attack,there is a moral duty to allow asylum seekers in need to live in safety in the eu.,"the duty to host asylum seekers should belong, first of all, to the neighbouring countries refugees are fleeing from because they are closer geographically and and more similar linguistically and culturally."
Support,"studies with findings supporting the gender equality paradox have typically used the global gender gap index gggi p. 6 , which is an unreliable and invalid measure of gender equality pp. 1 2 .","the global gender gap index unduly penalizes poor countries p. 6 , as evidenced by the fact that it shares a strong correlation with basic need satisfaction."
Attack,"public nudity is often meant to cause offense and punishment. in both historic and modern times, it has been used as a punishment meant to warn others of the consequences for wrong doing.",the practice of nude executions in europe drastically decreased in popularity by the 19th century.
Support,jail acts as a powerful incentive for users to get and stay clean.,"for some addicts, a jail sentence may act as a wake up call by indicating the extent of their drug problem."
Attack,the identity of rey's parents is teased throughout the force awakens as important for the new trilogy's story line. yet the movie casts this question away as unimportant.,"this has always been a point of the star wars movies: any individual can reach greatness, independent of where they come from and who their parents are. the decision to not care about rey's origin only emphasizes this."
Support,"most students do not enjoy school and, thus, have an interest in getting through it as conveniently as possible. but this is not necessarily what results in the best learning outcomes.","a nationwide survey in the us reported that nearly 75 of students consider schools tiring, boring and stressful."
Support,the benefit of being part of the eu's significant number of current and future trade deals outweighs any potential loss in control over negotiating trade deals that would come about from turkey joining the eu.,"the eu has finalised, but not yet signed , free trade agreements with 23 countries. these include a large group of west african and eastern african countries."
Attack,the great number of biblical manuscripts still in existence make the bible one of the most reliable ancient sources available in the world.,"the number and accuracy of manuscript copies are not evidence of the historical reliability of a source; for example, the different gospels contradict each other on a number of points."
Attack,"this could create a third division rife with unfairness, depending on the sex assigned at birth to competing athletes, their state of transition, and their hormone treatment plans.","if transgender athletes competing between each other would be unfair, then it would be even more unfair o allow them to compete against cis women."
Support,the buddhist concept of rebirth relies upon supernatural causes that lack evidence .,"in order to scientifically study and understand rebirth, we would first need to discover the underlying metaphysics , such as the existence and nature of identity, and determine what would qualify as sufficient evidence."
Support,"competition is wasteful, as it requires multiple groups to devise, build, maintain and protect independent systems. that is inherently inefficient.",trade secrets and copyrights prevent further innovation by restricting information access and the ability for modification.
Attack,"allowing women to be priests will prevent such suits, which can cost churches huge fortunes even if they win .",churches have won most of these cases and have received settlements for their legal costs.
Attack,the entire purpose of the law is to ensure that an individual's right to live their life as they choose does not impact anyone else's freedom and right to live their lives as they choose. abortion takes away someone else's right to live and to make choices when they are capable of doing that in the future.,the violin player thought experiment argues that the right to life does not include the right to use another person's body. abortion does not violate the fetus's right to life but merely deprives it of use of the mother's body to which it has no right.
Attack,"the most common trigger foods for some medical conditions such as celiac disease , irritable bowel syndrome ibs p. 547 , and g6pd deficiency are often staples of a vegan diet. people who have these conditions may find veganism difficult.","although top allergens are also the top vegan protein sources soy and wheat , most vegan companies offer products made from peas and almonds ."
Support,"mainstream modern cinema is driven almost exclusively by the profit margins, and star wars, for better or worse, has been dragged into it. the original trilogy was unique, with a singular, even esoteric vision, but has since been subsumed into the cinema industrial complex.","kubrick and scorsese have largely shunned the big budget blockbuster movie, because individual artistic freedom is restricted by the committees that finance it."
Attack,"a power other than a political, temporary majority maintains a division of powers in a monarchy. this is an important check on politicians.","if the monarch's role is politically important, the hereditary nature of their allocation is all the more worrying and undemocratic."
Attack,this is an argument against the us fiscal and political system and not against capitalism per se.,criticizing us fiscal policies and capitalism are not mutually exclusive since most of their fiscal policies are capitalist.
Attack,"the bill of rights and us constitution are quite old documents made when water access was not as complex as it is today; thus, they were not implemented.","these documents can also be amended, and yet no amendment has even been proposed on water as a right."
Attack,animal extinction can't be compared to human extinction.,"anything can be compared to anything else, and nonhuman animals have many things in common with humans."
Attack,"admiral ackbar, whom many fans got to love for his role in the earliest movies, dies unceremoniously, without relevance for the story and in an off hand manner.",akbar played hardly a significant role in the oldest movies either. he has barely any screen time and is famous only for a one liner. even in the force awakens he is merely an easter egg.
Attack,staking a claim to any intellectual framework is a political act .,"the development of our rational capabilities as we age can be sufficiently sophisticated to substantially counteract our initial tribal and emotional cognitive biases. essentially, allowing us to think in a way that is approximately universal that transcends tribal and political lines."
Attack,religion has provided an incredible amount of inspiration for talented artists throughout history.,religion has historically limited artistic expression.
Support,illegal drug and weapon purchases would be brought to a near halt.,black market is limited due to no under the table deals being made.
Attack,a common definition of a woman is an adult female human.,both what the body means and how it relates to social category varies between cultures and over time . woman remains a useful shorthand for the entanglement of femininity and social status regardless of biology.
Support,setting up private rehabilitation clinics is already legal legalising drugs would not do anything to spur more people to open such services.,"there are over 14,500 specialized drug treatment centres across the usa."
Attack,"science does not conclude that unfalsifiable untestable non empirical ideas are false; it simply has nothing to comment on the matter. therefore at most, science is agnostic.","if it cannot be determined from a scientific point of view whether or not a god exists, then agnosticism is the correct point of view pertaining to knowledge. however, if agnosticism is claimed, then withholding belief that a statement is true is justified. atheism is the lack of belief that theism is true, therefore, atheism is justified."
Support,socially responsible companies use tax cuts to benefit society .,"when president trump instituted a corporate tax cut in 2020, patagonia donated the money to environmental protection groups."
Attack,"there are roughly 1,000 anti government extremist groups in the us, and the vast majority of them consider gun rights to be paramount.",heavily armed right wing and white nationalist extremism has been responsible for many mass shootings and other acts of domestic terrorism ; the growing presence of these groups and the increased frequency of such events could be reduced or eliminated by new federal gun control regulations.
Attack,"not all special providences would be unfalsifiable because there could be evidence against the events. for example, the biblical story of the israelite's crossing the jordan river is falsifiable. one could claim that god communicated to the israelites that he would stop the waters of the jordan river that they might cross. this would be a great reason for israel to think that god was the one who dried up the river when they crossed it, even if god only accomplished this through natural means.",the claim that god communicated with these people or in current days a claim that god has communicated with an individual is unverifiable. for example if someone expected for some reason that the river would dry up by natural causes he could claim god told him so and no one could falsify that claim.
Support,"imported cases brought in by travel can have a confounding effect on data, making it difficult to reliably extrapolate results from it.",two countries with similar social distancing measures can see differences in the number of infections due to cases imported by travel.
Attack,"much of the reason for this may be the status of large corporations as monopolies, which is detrimental because it limits the innovation of smaller companies.","their functionality as a monopoly may limit market share of the smaller companies but it does not limit their innovation, per say. their contribution to technological advancement is beneficial to society, monopoly or not."
Support,the abolitionist movement was based on the belief of like minded religious groups that human beings should not be treated as property.,abolitionists sought to demonstrate the incompatibility of slavery with christian doctrine and were successful in recruiting many churches to their cause.
Attack,corporal punishment in school merely mirrors the operation of the criminal justice system.,criminal justice systems in many jurisdictions worldwide have been ineffective in reforming people's behavior.
Attack,fatwas issued by religious scholars do not have any authority to determine the beliefs of the average muslim.,"fatwas are only non binding in the sunni tradition in other traditions, they can be authoritative in some select cases p. 314 ."
Support,the universe and the prevailing laws of nature seem to be finely tuned only from the human perspective.,the creation of meaning to interpret and communicate perceived phenomena is a fundamental trait of the human species.
Support,"within the muslim family structure, the prophet muhammad decreed that children have greater obligations to their mothers than to their fathers.",muslim mothers have complete authority over their children and retain custody of them in divorce .
Support,"state socialism is hard to implement, unlike capitalism, where authority is given to businesses.","socialism has a history of failure, in many countries, including venezuela, cuba, the soviet union, and north korea."
Support,"our online relationships are owned and controlled by corporations, and are therefore harming our human relationships.",each social media platform controls how we interact with one another online. the majority of people communicating through social media are limited by platform guidelines.
Attack,"it is difficult for people, some more than others, to switch to more climate friendly diets.","dietary restrictions often require eliminating food items that are environment unfriendly, such as milk in the case of lactose intolerance . therefore, such restrictions are unlikely to be a deterrent to adopting climate friendly diets."
Support,"given that gender is a social construct , transgender people who identify as women should be accepted as a part of that group by wider society.","being transgender is not a choice and, as such, should be respected."
Attack,"if i asked you is there mail in your mailbox? , you'd have to decide yes, no, or i don't know. presuming you have a mailbox, and it receives mail, that is a reasonable question. in the state of nature, the question of god has not been asked; yet, with reason, it eventually is. once the question is asked, one must choose a positive, negative, or neutral stance. in this way, atheism is a negative position it is a no answer to a yes or no question; and therefore, it is not a non belief .",the proper analogy would be some one you don't know saying that there is mail in your mailbox. atheism would be akin to saying i don't believe this person but it is not the claim that there is no mail in the mailbox.
Support,"chosen and gender neutral pronouns should be adopted through natural acceptance and social change, not mandatory imposition.",the evolution of language should not be decided by governments due to the difficulties involved in crafting such changes for some languages.
Attack,decisions based on values that are society oriented with the greater good in mind are better for society than decisions based on individual interests.,society's interests are just the sum of individual interests. what determines the greater good is itself determined by the collection of individual's values.
Support,mandatory schooling often unnecessarily promotes moral and ethical values rather than encouraging students to choose values for themselves .,many teachers are unable to refrain from imposing their moral values on students and fail to assist students in making their own moral evaluations.
Support,palestinian authorities and communities have rejected land swaps on numerous occasions in the past.,"mahmoud abbas of the palestinian authority has stated that land swaps must be based on land of equal size and value, yet israel still hasn't committed to this principle. this alone dooms the possibility of agreeing on land swaps."
Support,most people are naturally deterred from engaging in unhealthy or risky behavior due to a fear of injury or death.,risk taking people are likely to behave the same way regardless of their financial situation.
Support,governments and political elites do not need to use an expanded definition of hate speech to restrict criticisms against them.,"governments often have other means of silencing criticism, like forms of intimidation or ways of deprioritizing the speech of dissidents."
Support,"since vampires look like humans , allowing the killing of vampires might lead to humans killing other humans accidentally.",being a vampire merely pertains to the diet and longevity of a person but often does not change their personality.
Support,"monarchies have the power of influence, within their countries and abroad, regardless of whether they retain hard power.","in the case of the british monarchy in its current state, many countries that were former colonies of britain enjoy increased diplomatic relations and cultural similarities that may fade without the monarchy present."
Support,"conservative attitudes towards sex, such as celibacy , are often highly stigmatized in sexually tolerant societies.","this, in turn, has the potential to contribute to the ostracization of social groups who choose to abstain from sex on the basis of a religious or moral belief."
Support,"the title x program provides family planning services to individuals who are facing significant barriers to obtaining healthcare, including people with lower incomes, ethnic minorities, rural residents, and lgbtq individuals.",the affected services were entirely unrelated to abortion procedures.
Attack,allowing women to become priests would help challenge the prevailing belief that christianity is a conservative and inflexible doctrine.,allowing women to become priests will not do much to change public perception of christianity.
Attack,it is far cheaper for high income countries to provide adequate aid for refugees residing in lower income countries than in high income countries.,"high income countries that provide funds for refugees within their borders, rather than for refugees settled elsewhere, retain greater control over what such funds are spent on."
Attack,both israelis and palestinians hold deep religious connections to the land.,jerusalem is the primary holy city of judaism but is considered by muslims to be the third holiest city behind mecca and medina.
Support,"only china, guatemala, taiwan, thailand, united states, and vietnam use lethal injection as a standard method of execution. alternatives are therefore readily available.",many alternatives are actually more humane. lethal injection at least without proper general anesthesia is likely excruciating .
Attack,"some feminists advocate for activisms that allow open conversation, frame conflict within reason as productive , and push the movement forward.","some female figureheads are targeted by a limiting groupthink that attempts to cancel them prior to any direct conflict or dialogue. this indicates that on balance, feminists may not push for open conversation."
Support,"on a metaphysical scale, benevolence may be defined in a way that incorporates the existence of evil.",presupposing the existence of evil also presupposes humankind at the center of existence. remove people from the center and the problem of evil disappears.
Support,"even if students individually adopt long term sustainable habits, they are unlikely to be enough to save the planet from a climate crisis.","individual's actions are not going to stop climate change, technological innovations and structural changes to society are needed in order to stop global warming."
Attack,"humans always seek greater self understanding, which agi could provide.","there are many psychological barriers to understanding one's self that many people don't try to overcome, as understanding themselves would be detrimental to their self image."
Support,planned parenthood has been accused of engaging in illegal activities.,undercover videos have alleged that planned parenthood sells fetal tissue. this is illegal under us law .
Attack,an eu army would be unable to counter a major aggressor such as russia without us aid.,"there is no reason why an economic giant like the eu, upon creating an army, should not be able to defend itself from russia even without the us."
Support,individual efforts from european countries have been enough; there is no need for the eu to act as a whole on the issue,"if combined, the efforts of individual eu countries and the eu as a body amount to a significant contribution."
Attack,"killing, infanticide , and cannibalism have been practiced by humans. those acts are not inherently evil .",modern ethical and religious beliefs state that these actions are evil.
Support,star voting encourages candidates to campaign positively.,"if two candidates have a similar ideology, voters can give more points to the more honest and polite person, without splitting votes or preventing their party from winning."
Attack,"for synthetic agi to be impossible, requires that existing examples of general intelligence humans do not run on reducible physical processes, e.g. by souls existing and being necessary for cognition. this is implausible.",such agi could be possible but require biological elements where then the adjective synthetic is debatable.
Attack,the bible supports jehovah's witness beliefs and teachings more than it supports the teachings of other groups.,"the bible teaches that jesus is god, contrary to jehovah's witness doctrine ."
Support,most adults have acquired life skills through experience and therefore can teach them.,"it is highly unlikely that a parent would not have any life skills to pass onto their children, since most adults need life skills to survive."
Attack,"if everyone was immortal, many people would choose to have less children.","even if people had less children, a 0 death rate would necessarily lead to overpopulation if any level of reproduction continued."
Support,many democratic countries have monarchies and maintain essential features of liberal democracies.,"public good provision without discrimination is a feature of liberal democracies . many european monarchies provide services like free healthcare and free or state funded higher education to their citizens, evidencing that monarchies are not opposed to democratic principles."
Support,"the power may initially be great, but over time, people might hate it, especially with the massive number of conflicts around the world.","another issue is the fact that the hero might find an issue like petty theft quite minuscule, especially when compared to larger crimes like mass genocide."
Support,no other planet within close proximity has the environmental conditions to support life.,"the earth has the right temperature to support organic life forms, based on its distance from the sun and core features."
Attack,"there wouldn't be a need for anti police protests, which disrupt the parade.","anti lgbtq groups can disrupt the parade. thus, police are needed to prevent this."
Support,legalizing marijuana will lower crime and benefit the criminal justice system.,"legalizing marijuana will also lower crime rates outside the eu, in countries where the product is mass produced."
Attack,"women face a lot of societal pressures, especially when dating.","given that dating is often framed as a market , and men are expected to be more successful in those domains, this might put pressure on them to find success in dating."
Attack,children from polygamous families are more likely to be bullied in school.,the responsibility lies with the one who bullies; not with the bullied one as it is her him that makes the selection.
Attack,more explicit forms of desegregation and anti discriminatory policies would more effectively mitigate existing discrimination.,"much of contemporary discrimination in rich countries does not take the form of legal exclusion, but rather manifests as implicit bias and structural power imbalances . desegregation reforms may not target this."
Attack,"farmers have historically taken land away from wildlife to farm crops, threatening some species. this is especially true of palm oil cultivation.","since a number of prominent vegan organizations have been very critical of palm oil, many vegans avoid using it."
Support,emotions have been found to play a highly important role in good decision making.,research has found that people with a damaged or underdeveloped prefrontal cortex the part of the brain that processes emotions have a decreased ability to make good decisions.
Attack,adoption of christianity often coincided with adoption of serfdom.,serfdom was tied to the fall of rome rather than the rise of christianity.
Support,planned parenthood offers free condom programs that support the human right to sexual and reproductive health .,safe sex has been recognized as a human right by the un office for human rights p. 18 .
Attack,"if there is no meaning of life, then the meaninglessness of life becomes the meaning of life. this is self defeating and logically paradoxical.","this is true in the practical sense of someone making the meaningless of life the meaning of their life, but it is not self defeating regarding the truth value of the statement there is no meaning of life."
Attack,"there are distinct lineages of buddhist teachers, and each successive generation is required to achieve the same level of attainment as its predecessor. this promotes an orderly and uniform succession and transmission of knowledge.","the different branches of buddhism disagree on central matters , such as the nature of the buddha, which shows inconsistency."
Support,"cross gender mentoring relationships face many challenges from a female point of view, as women are more likely than men to find themselves with a mentor of the opposite sex p. 205 .","those in cross gender mentoring relationships assume more gender stereotypical roles, which contributes to an unlevel playing field for women and hinders opportunity for advancement p. 206 ."
Attack,making it socially unacceptable to be obese will increase bullying of obese people.,"this discouragement doesn't have to take the form of shaming individuals, but can rather be framed as a collective problem in which everyone has a stake."
Support,minorities often struggle to reclaim historically looted art . some items remain within nations with limited links to the source culture outside of colonisation or theft.,"even powerful nations struggle to have items returned. this is shown in the case of the greek elgin marbles , which exemplify the difficulties that arise in repatriating art."
Support,"alien abductee terry lovelace claims to have been visited in hospital where he was at due to ufo abduction related injuries by officers of which one appeared to know what lovelace and his colleague had seen despite them not telling anybody, asking whether he had taken any photos, subsequently apparently being glad that they didn't. later he was reportedly injected with a drug and hypnotized for the same question to be asked likely to make sure he didn't take photos and to make him forget.","in 2019, it was reported that a human skull found at devil's den has been identified as missing oklahoma man. this is at the restricted area where the alleged alien abduction of terry lovelace took place."
Support,"in most modern corporations, joint stake and regulations with diverse interests make it that no single individual has enough power to make changes.","even when company leaders have an interest in pursuing sustainability, they may be opposed by shareholders who would be worried about the impact on profits."
Support,pc stifles discourse by social sanctions that encourage individuals and institutions to self censor speech and thought.,the 'social conventions' voluntarily adhered to through pc leads to self censorship pg 430 through paranoia .
Attack,new atheists often disagree in their critiques of modern religious conflicts.,different authors maintaining their individual political viewpoints is not inconsistent with addressing secular and religious hypocrisy and evil.
Support,"even if the green new deal does not include carbon taxes or caps, there are independent efforts by many groups in the us towards this policy. these efforts, combined with the green new deal, will cause significant reduction in the environmental damage being caused.","in the northeastern united states , nine states have set a cap on emissions from the power sector and require companies to buy tradeable pollution permits."
Support,"bathrooms are purely functional for men, while women report seeking comfort and ease from a bathroom. to include men in this safe place may compromise this function.",it seems likely that women's toilets are considered a sanctuary against sexism.
Support,survival games may give players a false sense of confidence that they have real world knowledge and skills when they do not.,"game mechanics in survival games are mere approximations, simplifications, and abstractions of real life survival skills."
Support,protests at abortion clinics draw attention to the abortion debate and improve the quality of discourse.,"the debate over abortion rights often fades into the background of political discourse, which means that important policy reforms are delayed."
Attack,"we haven't built autonomous self directed ai agents yet, but that is a contingent fact about how far technology has progressed to date, not an eternal truth.",we also haven't built a self replicating exoplanet mining robot which is no reason we need to greatly worry about that now rather than about the contemporary and near future mining issues on earth. addressing that also is relevant and more constructive to addressing the hypothetical former issue.
Support,"descriptions of the scientific method avoid political language, and any analysis of its usage in a political context exceeds the scope of the thesis.","science, like math, is a system under which we examine and then test ideas. the results are descriptions of reality. anyone, regardless of politics, can try to oppose them but only with facts and data. science, like math, is political only to the extent that politics not based on objective reality may try to argue against data based reality. eg. politics vs. galileo galilei ."
Attack,switching to a green energy supplier can make a huge difference in global warming levels.,not everyone has access to green energy suppliers where they live.
Support,it is very unclear if unaligned synthetic superintelligent agi is practically possible or significantly likely.,the claim is not about whether 'unaligned' advanced agi is physically impossible but whether 'unaligned advanced agi' is possible. it could be that only agis that are aligned are possible.
Attack,"trade deals often include agreements to standardise environmental regulations between countries. this decreases the number of states in which exploitative companies could operate freely, leaving them with fewer places to move to.","while trade deals can be useful in dealing with the issue of standardizing environmental regulation, they are clearly a less far reaching and effective solution than a one world state."
Attack,the premise that the universe was caused is an assumption. it is possible that the universe has always existed as an uncaused phenomena.,"such an uncaused universe would be a god. it would inherently be omnipotent, omniscient, and omnibenevolent."
Support,all animals have a right to live and be free of suffering.,70 billion animals are sacrificed every year for consumption .
Attack,there remains no evidence that capital punishment effectively deters violent crime.,twelve papers published by economists all conclude that capital punishment does deter murder p. 5 .
Support,users have a responsibility to themselves and others not to submit data that will prove to be personally embarrassing or socially compromising.,users make the decision to put information out in such an insecure environment and should bear responsibility for the consequences of that decision.
Attack,parents have existing legal parental responsibilities which are mandatory upon them. taking away the right to choice in breastfeeding would not be unique.,"the existing requirements of parents are describing the overall result feeding, whereas requiring breastfeeding would be describing a very specific and narrow act."
Attack,"since instances of false rape accusations are incredibly rare, the fear of being accused of sexual misconduct is irrational.","rape accusations are only irrational if you're part of the majority group; black men in the us are overwhelmingly more likely to be accused than their white counterparts, likely fuelled by a dangerous history of presumed sexual immorality."
Attack,"humans feel a strong sense of empathy for other humans, especially those close to them. eating a baby causes harm to the mother and father, and to their family, friends and neighbours. eating a chimpanzee, by contrast, does not have the same impact.","this does not consider situations where the baby's parents are not alive anymore or have lost all contact to the baby earlier. more importantly, that it can't have a similar impact for chimpanzees is not backed up, especially when such cases are considered."
Support,the top 10 of earners in the usa pay over half of all federal income tax even though they account for only 45 of all income.,"when switzerland was debating the introduction of a 12:1 salary cap, the policy was forecast to lead to major financial losses."
Attack,"we are going to have an unbelievable, perhaps record setting turnout for the inauguration was a statement of sheer arrogance, particularly ironic in retrospect given how few turned up .",the explanation of the confusion was later explained because the crowd looked big from president trump s vantage point at the capitol .
Support,police being in attendance is a matter of public safety.,hate crimes increase during pride month. having police present in solidarity with the lgbtq community is necessary for their safety.
Support,"the simplest explanation for what we don't understand is that we don't understand yet, not that there is an all powerful supreme being that is making it happen.","all that science can explain does not require a superior being as a hypothesis. as our understanding covers more questions about nature, resorting to a deity for explaining the unknown becomes less justifiable."
Attack,"since there are natural explanations of decision making p. 6217 , non physical concepts like the self or the soul are unnecessary.","while natural implies the lack of a spirit, it does not entail eliminating psychological notions of the soul, beliefs, or the mind ."
Support,"it is a 'strawman fallacy' to refute a non defended claim that god is 'all powerful, all knowing, and all loving'. at the very least, this is a hasty generalization of what some might have argued and taken out of context. but regardless, it is an obviously deliberate mischaracterization of theism and biblical texts. specifically, there are many well known statements reportedly made by god himself that repudiate these premises.","god forgives and even choses to forget and is therefore not all knowing. jeremiah 23:39 , isaiah 65:17 , jeremiah 31:34 ."
Support,the un's courts are notoriously ineffective and are unlikely to cause any problems for either the wagner group or russia.,"the lack of enforcement mechanisms, coupled with the us's unwillingness to submit to the icc, makes its measures largely ineffective against powerful states like russia."
Attack,inequality needs to exist in order to give workers the motivation to do better.,"inequality in capitalism is a byproduct of the interaction between capitalists and the working class as well as market forces and pure luck. it is not, therefore, a motivational force."
Support,many humans have died as a result of environmental or climate conditions.,many humans have died as a result of natural disasters.
Support,"in a one world state, there would likely be institutional processes in place to reduce the external influence of powerful actors and interest groups.","elected members of this state will have a re election incentive to keep a check on powerful actors, interest groups, and themselves."
Attack,"in many cultures, gender is attributed to inanimate objects, such as rocks and water. this implies that humans consider gender to be intrinsic to everything that exists.","the attribution of gender to inanimate objects is a form of anthropomorphism , similar to how people sometimes hear voices in the wind. however, just because a person perceives such a thing does not mean it really exists."
Attack,"spousal consent for sterilization is a legal requirement in many countries. in such instances, the physicians are merely complying with the law.","spousal consent requirements for voluntary sterilization are not gender specific , yet they are imposed primarily on women, not men."
Attack,many ardent followers of religion see involving their children in their religious practices important to the actualization of their child's life as well. denying parents the ability to do so might harm their ability to self realize.,"many ardent followers of religion engage in child abuse that they deem important because of their interpretation of biblical verses such as spare the rod, spoil the child . we must still protect children against the abuses of their parents, regardless of their beliefs or self image."
Attack,"without some way to reliably measure religiosity it is impossible to state whether societies are more, or less, religious given their economic status.","gallup and pew polls, for instances, are made with large samples of respondents in each country who are asked if religion is important for them or in their lives . self report surveys may be limited as research tools, but they do provide some reliable data and are used in a huge variety of fields."
Attack,"the role of the state is to ensure that all of its citizens can live comfortably. if public nudity impedes general comfort, it can and should be banned.",governments resolve conflicting interests by balacing the protection of freedom and minimizing harm. allowing public nudity while continuing to criminalize sexual crimes allows for this balance.
Attack,"while it might be that a certain degree of evil and suffering is necessary for any possible world, our world is characterized by excessive suffering.","the criteria for excessive suffering is impossible to gauge. it is possible that even our experience of overwhelming suffering could provide knowledge and perspective that could prove to be a net positive, should for instance, there be an afterlife, and if this suffering would give us better perspective and knowledge to appreciate it."
Support,"women may feel uncomfortable using bathrooms shared with men, due to common notions that men are more unhygienic.","women perceive men's bathrooms as dirty, a perception which will likely transfer to gender neutral bathrooms. given that a perceived lack of hygiene leads to unhygienic behaviour, gender neutral bathrooms, on average, may become less hygienic."
Attack,"professors would be more responsible attend every class, be polite, etc. if students had power over them.","teachers should be doing this regardless of students having power; if they aren't upholding basic standards of teaching, that would usually be monitored by administration."
Attack,"understanding technology is not the same as using technology. one needs to understand in order to be able to assess advantages and disadvantages, opportunities and risks.",making coding compulsory may be dangerous as you could increase the number of hackers.
Support,"the internet is not a physical space, so no law can govern it.",the internet does not have borders like nation states.
Attack,"in luke 24, two men in clothes that gleamed like lightning appeared to the women. however, matthew 28 and mark 16 say, an angel of the lord came down from heaven , and a young man dressed in a white robe sitting on the right side , respectively.","matthew 28 and mark 16 do not claim that only one man or angel was present. perhaps there were two angels, but only one was the spokesperson, which is why matthew 28 and mark 16 don't mention the other one."
Support,"most societies recognise an individual's right to religious identity, which is often self designated.",several european nations are gradually moving towards the acceptance of gender self identification as a social norm.
Support,"miscarriage of justice can be rectified through several means, so pardons are not necessary.","in some countries, such as india, courts are empowered to take suo moto action to rectify miscarriages of justice. granting us courts similar power would promote self correction by the judiciary."
Support,"the world bank sponsored iaastd report, one of the most comprehensive reports on the future of agriculture, did not endorse gmos as a solution to world hunger p. 2 .","the poorest portions of the world could benefit most from more resources being devoted to r d for cassava, millet, sorghum, and potatoes pp. 16 17 ."
Support,economists say it is challenging to transition workers whose jobs have become irrelevant to new careers.,job retraining programs have historically had little success in the united states.
Support,"president trump repealed elements of the affordable healthcare act by executive order , which were costing americans a fortune.","president trump included a provision in his 2017 legislation to eliminate the obamacare penalt y, which cost 695 per adult or 2.5 of household income."
Attack,pope francis' changes to the image of the catholic church are solely superficial and reflect no meaningful change.,the fact that pope francis has upset many conservative catholics reflects that he has made significant changes.
Attack,the gospels are inconsistent with respect to the events around jesus' resurrection. this inconsistency greatly detracts from the plausibility of treating these accounts as reliable.,the first clue to cheating on a test is when the grader notices that there are no differences. likewise accounts from different people ought to present different manifestations of events.
Attack,"humans already live out of their natural environment, instead they live in cities that they view as superior environments.","unlike animals, forced to live in man made zoos, no one is forcing humans to live in man made cities."
Support,asking someone their preferred name and pronouns shows care and compassion for an individual who may desperately need the love and compassion.,"the suicide rate among trans people is much higher than that for other groups. gender based discrimination, victimization, bullying, and rejection from friends, family or the community, all play a role in this."
Support,they may be very different from us in a multitude of ways.,we do not know much about extraterrestrial life as we only have scientific data on one advanced civilization bearing lifeform humans. other evolutionary paths and options and so on could and possibly would be fairly alien to us.
Support,"much bdsm activity, such as between lesbian couples, can involve no men at all.",some lesbian couples have reported that bdsm brought the couple closer together .
Support,"education on gender identity and sexual orientation is ideological rather than factual, and we should not open the door to teaching ideological topics in schools.","policy makers and educators should take care to not represent any political view in particular, as this would mean indoctrinating students."
Support,traditional meat sources that were farmed and slaughtered could also be replaced by cell cultured meats or plant alternatives.,see discussion 16485: lab grown meat is a suitable replacement for factory farming.
Support,"its most famous proponent, cesar millan, has been criticized for the methods he uses.",national geographic channel even shows a warning at the beginning of millan's show urging people to not try this at home without consulting a professional.
Support,there are several ways to easily and accurately determine the gender and gender identity of a person.,there are respectful ways to make situations comfortable for everyone to share their gender.
Support,"animals in captivity are at risk of suffering from 'zoochosis ', characterized by obsessive, repetitive behaviors like rocking, swaying and pacing.","animals in zoos show signs of psychosis and post traumatic stress disorder. many will exhibit worrying repetitive behaviour such as hitting its head or chewing its own tail that is not observed in the wild, this shows that the animal is psychologically disturbed. observing these facts, we should not subject sentient animals to endure this kind of abuse."
Support,there are reports of abusive behavior by men pretending to be trans women accessing women only spaces in order to prey on vulnerable women.,sexual assault against women increased significantly following the publication of target s gender inclusion policy in april 2016.
Support,true feminists or equalists strive for equality between the sexes.,"the wage gap , for example, exists in some countries and industries while it does not exist in others."
Attack,"video games often promote regularly playing for long periods of time without stopping, which puts gamers at an increased risk of serious health problems later in life.",studies have shown that particularly action packed video games can improve one's performance on sensorimotor tasks.
Attack,"rudy giuliani won time's person of the year award , and is considered 'america's mayor' and so should be trusted.",that had nothing to do with giuliani's potential abilities as a lawyer.
Support,"more than half of the world's refugees currently come from syria, afghanistan, and south sudan. years of engagement by the international community have not been able to pacify the situation in these countries. this is unlikely to change.","prolonged efforts of the international community have been unsuccessful in pacifying long lasting conflicts that have sparked large refugee streams, for example those in somalia, sudan, and the dr congo p. 16 ."
Attack,culture and technology differentiates humans from animals.,"neuroscience proves that culture is nothing more than a larger number of neural connections. charles lumsden states, all living things take in information and in turn respond based on the operating system they have. humans have more inputs and a higher amount of neurons to make sense of those inputs compared to other animals, but the structure and function of the two systems are at their core the same. source"
Attack,"because the apparent indicators of sex vary in their ability to accurately describe the sex of a person, we are sometimes misled when relying on them. that does not mean we should abandon the use of them. they are generally accurate, if imperfect, tools for the recognition of sex.","these indicators are used to recognize gender, not sex."
Attack,ukraine has had a working partnership with nato since 1991 ; therefore they should be allowed to join it.,a history of cooperation does not preclude membership in an organization.
Support,innocent civilians are always a victim of war. this has no bearing on whether the war is justifiable or not.,collateral damage tends to happen during violent conflicts.
Attack,"by improving and stabilising the revenues of producers in developing countries, fair trade directly complements efforts towards community development and social welfare infrastructure within developing countries.",fairtrade maintains developing countries in a disadvantageous economic specialisation. it would be more beneficial to them to export manufactured goods instead of agricultural products .
Attack,necromancy would not have been practiced in judea.,simon magus practiced sorcery in samaria acts 8:9 .
Support,it would be better to spend taxpayer money on improving a nation's defensive capabilities than on purchasing art.,"without proper defenses, a nation including its culture and art can be destroyed by an enemy force."
Support,working long hours is detrimental to one's health and encounters diminishing returns.,"working 80 hours a week does not result in increased output. thus, working long hours is unnecessary and at the expense of the employee."
Attack,using mobile phones in the classroom would lead to an increase in distractions and interruptions.,evidence suggests that mobile phones positively aid students in classroom learning.
Attack,habakkuk 2:15 condemns drunkenness but not moderate alcohol consumption.,"habakkuk 2:15 says, woe to him who gives drink to his neighbors, pouring it from the wineskin till they are drunk, so that he can gaze on their naked bodies! however, this goes far beyond moderate alcohol consumption and is borderline date rape."
Attack,infant circumcision means that an adult doesn't have to get circumsized when marrying a spouse from a pious muslim or jewish family.,"preemptively circumcising everyone with the idea that they won't have to be circumcised later if they decide to marry into certain families seems like a very badly thought out idea. by the same logic, we should also start to baptise everyone on the possibility that they marry into christian family, feed them only food that is halal and kosher and hinduists approve, because what if.. and the list goes on."
Support,early evidence suggests that deep sea hydrothermal vents were the birthplace of life on earth. learning more about the origins of life is of both intrinsic and instrumental value.,"if we can confirm that hydrothermal vents can generate organic lifeforms, this will inform space exploration as we can look for planets with similar characteristics."
Support,most great inventions and discoveries of our world were created by western scientists.,the west is at the forefront of technological advancements and has been since the renaissance .
Support,increasing leisure time shares available paid work among citizens more evenly and reduces inequality.,underemployment worsens the growing problem of income inequality. sharing work amongst citizens would help address this.
Attack,the us both recognizes a number of entities associated with terrorist organizations and has previously supported terrorist groups to overthrow established governments.,"the designation of terrorist organization is an arbitrary distinction that does not necessarily reflect the manner of violence, the scale of violence, or the threat to the united states. the designation is based only on political concerns."
Attack,banning cars could happen gradually e.g. city centre outwards and temporarily e.g. sundays first to demonstrate the benefits and allow people and business to adapt slowly .,the need for banning cars in cities is urgent ; they should be banned completely as soon as possible.
Attack,"the traditional omniscient, omnipotent god knows all things, including what things will happen in the future. that knowledge includes his own future actions, which prevents god from choosing other actions, creating a contradiction.","if god knows the future as possibilities not certainties, and if he knows all possible futures then he can act in the present to change the future without contradiction."
Attack,"vertical farming creates jobs over time, whereas conventional farming does not as much.","fewer vertical farms are needed than conventional ones to generate the same amount of produce, which could translate to fewer jobs to maintain them."
Support,"universally available preventive health care, as opposed to complete universal health care, can effectively fulfill a state's duty to protect a person's right to life.",every dollar spent on preventing obesity has a six fold return on investment.
Support,"branding refugees as a security risk is counterproductive, running the risk of becoming a self fulfilling prophecy .",treating refugees as security threats fuels intolerance and gives terrorists a potent recruitment tool to convince young muslims that the west has no place for them.
Attack,putin's power has been on the decline as a result of the loss of strategic allies.,"putin has been able to retain the loyalty of nations such as north korea, iran, and belarus."
Attack,humanity creates devastation wherever they go; this should not continue on mars.,"there is no life on mars, hence there is little significant devastation that could be caused."
Attack,tv programs can foster and encourage good behaviour in children.,the negative effects of tv on children far outweigh the positive effects.
Support,the british monarch appoints the prime minister of the uk.,the monarch's ability to appoint a prime minister becomes vital when no party holds a clear majority in parliament.
Attack,getting paid a living wage would be good for workers.,"as of 2017, only 12.3 of workers were living below the poverty line in the us, so investing in a living wage is not a priority."
Support,the practice of delivering physical punishment can negatively influence the behaviour of teachers who execute it.,"teachers might become overly reliant on corporal punishment, neglecting the development of more positive teaching and disciplinary strategies."
Support,"according to the european social survey , many nations' interest in leaving the eu has significantly decreased.",membership of the eu has been viewed as more favourable in light of ongoing crises and the eu's responses.
Support,"bullying of lgbtq students is widespread in schools . learning about these topics would promote positive attitudes towards lgbtq people, thereby reducing the likelihood of bullying.",it would lower the 33 lgbtq youth being bullied at school and prevent further harassment.
Support,"an orbital ring would be a great alternative and might be extremely challenging, but pretty feasible.",orbital rings are a great start towards expand earth's civilization out of earth. a space elevator does not provide such opportunity.
Support,"teachers have the ability to influence children both directly and indirectly. by wearing religious symbols, teachers can lead students to believe that they as an agent of the state endorse a particular religion.","in most cases, the us supreme court has ruled that displaying religious symbols does not pass the lemon test , a test that details legislation concerning religion in the us."
Attack,this is irrelevant; the fact that one method of capital punishment may result in a painful death does not in any way lead to the conclusion that all forms of capital punishment are torture.,"given that lethal injections are considered among the most modern and humane forms of capital punishment, it is very relevant that they can lead to painful deaths."
Support,"if the negotiations had failed, mutual tariffs and quotas barriers would have resulted, which would have had a negative impact on the uk economy, including a drop in economic activity due to higher prices and additional bureaucracy.",the eu has been the uk's largest trade partner 49 of total uk trade in 2018 . brexit can end this partnership due to mutual taxes and tariffs.
Attack,"it is not just how an animal dies that matters, but how it lives. a free life, even one with a temporarily painful end, is arguably preferable to a life in a cage, especially when some of the more barbaric and cruel factory farming practices de beaking, other forms of un anaesthetized mutilation, insufficient health care to prevent diseases from spreading across the herd, etc. come into play.","this is a claim against factory farming, not eating meat. there are many ways to humanely raise and harvest the animals."
Attack,"mandatory schooling increases literacy rates, and a literate population is necessary for modern economies to function.",humans may not need to be literate in the future if the majority of work is done by ai and governments institute a universal basic income system.
Support,numerous decisions of characters are hard to comprehend.,"snoke is apparently concerned about his safety, hence the bodyguards. yet he allows rey into his throne room with a weapon and fails to realize that kylo ren is turning on him, even though he can apparently read and control minds."
Attack,"the rendlesham forest ufo jim penniston incident includes some elements that point to time travel. penniston hypothesized interdimensional type craft, and it's clearly us from the future .","assuming the witness is telling the truth, this is not even a remotely clear hint to time travel for example some aliens may like to have it appear as if they're capable of such but aren't actually."
Support,states have no way of verifying whether groups are offended by some speech. those who claim to be the most offended can thus gain an outsized influence on discourse in society.,"a previously existing law prohibiting blasphemy in ireland proved impossible to enforce, as it was difficult to prove when language had blasphemous intent and genuinely offended someone who had religious convictions."
Attack,anti drug laws permit law enforcement to enter properties without prior notice .,no knock warrants are essential to prevent the destruction of evidence.
Attack,"no human necessity, including water, food, clothing, and shelter, is completely publicly funded, so education shouldn't be either.","if government does not directly provide these things, it is their responsibility to make sure people can provide them for themselves. one of the best ways to do this is to provide access to education, which gives people access to good jobs."
Attack,"the fact that eating meat is natural or inherent to human culture does not imply that we ought to eat it. according to hume, it is a fallacy to make claims about what ought to be we ought to eat meat on the basis of statements about what is it is natural to eat meat .",'what is' is a better indicator than philosophical thoughts on 'what ought to be' because it has shown its applicability.
Support,many children awaiting adoption are never adopted p. 2 .,"abortion bans in romania led 150,000 infants to be put in poorly run state orphanages. decades later, many of still suffer from poor mental and physical health."
Support,religion has historically been leveraged to achieve the emancipation of women in some places; feminists can emulate this to empower liberatory sects.,"african feminists have emphasised the importance of religion in building equal communities, counter to the secular focus on autonomy that western feminists often advocate for p. 145 ."
Attack,"if someone seems human, the simplest explanation is not that it is a being with both a divine and human nature, but rather merely one with only a human nature.",this is not necessarily the case if we have evidence other than just the fact that a person seems human.
Attack,police being in attendance is a matter of public safety.,"with crime rates at their present unacceptable levels, police time and resources would be better spent dealing with this ever growing problem."
Support,the act of repatriation can cause headline scandals for the country that took the art.,this implicates museums and galleries with the actions of states.
Attack,it is important to leave confederate memorials and monuments up to teach our own painful history.,public spaces are decorated as much for art as anything. teaching history is only a fraction of the impact of a space.
Attack,"mixed sex is not synonymous with gender blind. therefore, mixed sex schools may still impose gendered rules and practices that complicate school life for gender diverse students.","mixed sex schools could adopt gender blind policies, such as gender neutral bathrooms and dress codes. however, this would not be possible in single sex schools, as gender segregation is antithetical to gender blindness."
Support,the vast majority of people who are infected with polio don't even show any symptoms.,"only 1 2 resulted in nonparalytic meningitis, and fewer than 1 resulted in paralysis. among paralytic cases, many recovered completely and most recovered muscle function to some degree."
Attack,"in a pre political state of nature , we would have been free to act and behave in certain ways. as such, these are naturally occurring freedoms and rights that cannot legitimately be undermined in a polity.","in social contract theory , the state with unlimited individual freedom is the natural state, and the transition to society requires the restriction of freedom."
Support,disputes within royal families have been a major contributor to wars .,many wars that ravaged europe since the middle ages were due to disputes about monarchical succession .
Attack,"if there were no borders, it would be much harder to track and catch criminals or suspects as they moved across them.","without borders, police would be able to pursue suspects well past the boundaries which would previously have hindered them."
Attack,god is what allows us to derive the concept of the unobservable 'way things should be' from the observable 'way things are'.,"we observe many things, and some things we consider better than others. we can form a concept of the way things should be merely by increasing the proportion of things we consider better, and this can be done wholly without reference to god."
Attack,"basing policy decisions on a pure majority opinion is just mob rule and allows the larger group to take from the smaller one, even if it's only slightly bigger.",this majority opinion is not simply a case of 'mob rule'. the majority of the american people are morally entitled to restitution from high earning ceos.
Support,"poor grades can be a motivating factor for students with low self esteem, leading to better grades and mental health in the future.",studies have shown that individuals with low self esteem are motivated by initial failure.
Support,"making a decision with a small majority is a sign that the decision may well be the wrong one. most democratic changes should require a large majority, with the exception of time sensitive changes, which could be handled by the executive branch.",this is similar to the emergency powers and executive orders that the executive branch in the us has.
Attack,"people who go through an existential crisis are often changed and improved after recovering from the crisis, with a different understanding about themselves, and their chosen purpose s in life.","after getting through one existential crisis, another challenge to your sense of self can arise. over the many lifetimes of immortality, this could reach unprecedented levels."
Support,the discounting of the total cost of any self defense class or session might be discriminatory when it comes to heterosexual people or other minority participants who are interested in learning self defense for themselves.,about 35 of women globally and 70 of women nationally have experienced some form of physical or sexual violence. offering such a discount to lgbt members prioritizes this group over women.
Support,"it is widely acknowledged that women are unlikely to report sexual assault and rape; therefore, statistics are under reported and under prosecuted .",the trauma of having been raped is not dissimilar to that of war induced ptsd in soldiers; this likely prevents many women from coming forward with their stories.
Attack,the structured and consistent routine that school enforces for all students can have a positive impact on their mental health.,"the routine provided by schools only exists while a child is attending school. children may struggle to develop a routine independently and will not reap the associated benefits once they leave school, or during any period of absence during their childhood."
Attack,"there are a number of low cost options to reduce carbon emissions, including reforestation and nuclear power .",enerygy from new nuclear power plants can cost around three times as much as that from renewable sources.
Support,two examples of nations that have survived territorial losses and afterwards created reasonably successful societies are sweden and denmark.,denmark lost 25 of its territory against prussia in 1864 . but it thrived after that for 75 years and continued to do so after the occupation during ww2.
Attack,humans are able to create through the use of the intellect. it is very natural to infer that the human ability to create through intelligence is a reflection of nature.,"ultimate boeing 747 gambit : positing a designer for nature is self defeating because who designed the designer? pushing the problem back a step accomplishes nothing. we need a crane, not a skyhook."
Support,increasing progressive tax rates and introducing wealth taxes would reduce income inequality more effectively than a maximum wage.,wealth inequality is a more significant contributor to economic inequality in the us than income inequality. a wealth tax would be a better solution to inquality.
Support,"god can't be the explanation to something , since that refers to anything that is not nothing. god would not be nothing.","nothing refers to total absence or nonexistence as in north of the north pole . god would not be nothing. thus, it can't be the explanation. something does not refer to any thing as the word suggests, but only to not nothing the negation of nothingness in the sense of total absence there is nothing north of the north pole applied to totality ."
Support,globalisation advances society's technological progress.,globalisation brings the human race closer to becoming a k1 civilization on the kardashev scale.
Support,"they are taken politically seriously with lots of relevant things occurring during the 2020s such as the eu ai act, the uk's ai safety summit, and lots of media reporting and political debate.",events and developments that focused to a large degree on existential risks from ai include the uk's 2023 ai safety summit .
Attack,students will be more engaged and motivated to learn if they feel that they can apply lessons later on in life.,"life skills courses may be dubbed 'easy a' classes, and the ultimate aim may be lost in the process of students hoping to inflate their gpa."
Support,some non surgical gender affirming procedures can harm an individual's ability to have biological children .,minors who first use puberty blockers and subsequently hormones risk being unable to have biological children .
Attack,many of the wealthy who donated or invested much of their income to the protection of the environment will no longer be able to do so because of the increase in taxes.,"if charity donations are still tax deductible , a lot of wealthy individuals will still donate."
Attack,even those who are vaccinated can spread the virus.,the cdc established that it was highly unlikely that those who have been vaccinated will be able to transmit covid 19.
Attack,nudity doesn't fit the traditional definition of a social harm .,"some forms of harm, such as those associated with nudity, are more ambiguous and therefore hard to legislate against."
Attack,"even if human made evil must exist in order to grant humans free will, this does not explain the existence of non human evils like natural disasters.",natural disasters are part of a changing world and have effects that are fortunate for some and unfortunate for others. they are not good or evil in the absolute.
Attack,more inclusive women only spaces are stronger and help increase the representation of diverse voices.,"women only spaces, like all gendered spaces, perpetuate gender oppression."
Support,it is hard to be proven guilty when one directly intervenes into the investigation of his own abuse of power. president trump stopped and tainted the process and made this claim of unproven guilt empty and irrelevant in his case.,president trump fired the director of the fbi who was responsible for the process of accountability.
Support,"it is a misconception that serving time in prison completely clears one's record; in reality, a criminal record is kept on file for a reason.",ex convicts face movement and residential restriction s after release.
Support,movies in different cultural settings have employed dark humor.,"in jojob rabbit , dark humor has been employed to make fun of nazi germany."
Support,non meat products can offer an equivalently pleasing food experience.,"the taste of vegetables, fruits and grains is popular as well."
Attack,the right to consume whatever type of product you like should be at the heart of the industry because it is people's choices that determine what products are made in the first place.,it's unclear how ensuring more video games portray gender equality prevents one from consuming whatever type of product you want.
Support,that both buddhism and science place emphasis on causality is not much indication that they are compatible.,many unscientific ideologies place emphasis on causality.
Attack,"voters can use randomness coins, dice, computers, etc to work around the problem of a coarse ballot if the number of voters is large.","this may be impractical for voters, as they must either bring the randomizer into the voting booth which is time consuming and people may forget or do it at home and thus have to remember ."
Attack,feminism's propensity to point out sexism where it does not exist eclipses other sociocultural issues.,"feminists are often decried as irrational so they gain very little from pointing out sexism where it does not exist. given this, feminists overwhelmingly call attention to serious real world oppressions to maintain some social respect."
Attack,excess deaths caused by covid 19 were comparable to those caused by influenza during the severe phases of influenza epidemics.,the 2018 19 seasonal influenza is not representative of all seasonal influenzas.
Attack,climate change increases the spread of infectious diseases .,"climate change alone doesn't increase it, several other factors including ecological changes, human behavior, and the state of public health systems also have an impact on disease transmission ."
Support,some software isn't available for linux and can't be run with wine or mono.,linux doesn't run the adobe creative cloud applications.
Support,pursuing someone publicly for sex can be fun and rewarding for both parties.,the process of flirting can be good for the mental health of both parties. normalising approaching strangers for sex can make these benefits more widespread.
Support,"france, china, and russia are among countries reported to also investigate ufos and to have had numerous peculiar uap incidents.","there also reports and public recordings of peculiar ufos outside the u.s. from u.s. sources, such as what appears to be a flying ball in a middle eastern country filmed by a u.s. military drone."
Support,"the original hyde amendment allowed exceptions in cases where the mother's life was in danger p. 1434 . the exceptions have since been expanded, and many states now allow the use of federal funds for abortions in cases of life endangerment, rape, or incest .",rape related pregnancy is a pervasive and serious issue for many rape victims.
Support,"some scientists believe that, as the global climate is a dynamic system, it can correct itself.","increases in warming create more cloud cover, which can reduce warming. this shows that the earth's temperatures could be regulated to some extent p. 2817 ."
Support,"exposure to work provides students an opportunity to learn the complexities of emerging and fast growing industries, which cannot be replicated in formal schooling.","employers increasingly report a need for workers that know how to reskill and upskill on the job, demonstrating that mandatory education is currently unfit for purpose p. 36 ."
Attack,cryptocurrencies benefit the average person more than fiat currencies.,setting up a cryptocurrency account is complicated and requires technical understanding.
Attack,gillick competence is a criterion healthcare professionals use to determine whether a child can meaningfully consent to a medical procedure. this same criterion can be used for gender affirming procedures.,"immunization and contraception use are significantly less serious and life altering than gender affirming procedures. as such, gillick competence is not a sufficient assessment."
Attack,feminism in legislation is harmfully biased against men.,"laws are more likely to be unjustly biased against women than men, such that any imbalance that feminists may introduce would be limited in its effect."
Attack,the paris agreement does not demand anything of anyone; it is just mutual agreement trying to protect the planet.,there re no meaningful repercussions for violations violators.
Support,our right to freedom of choice is relative. impositions on our freedom of choice need to be weighed up against other factors such as our access to alternatives.,"if a movie theatre shows only one movie, banning people from watching that movie is very bad. if it shows 20, banning people from watching one of them is not as bad. this shows that the moral wrongness of restrictions on choice is proportionate to the availability of alternatives."
Attack,restricting hate speech would likely be unable to meaningfully reduce trolling.,"other factors, such as youtube removing the dislike button, are likely to have more of an impact on reducing trolling than restricting valid forms of speech."
Support,"a good zoo provides an enriched habitat in which the animals are never bored, are well cared for, and have plenty of space.",the idea of a zoo is good: teach people about animals and create a love and respect for their wellbeing in the world. but often execution is poor. zoos definitely need to be reformed to be more conducive to the animals' natural habitats and way of life.

Support,there is an important difference between discrimination and reciprocated segregation. both religious and lgbtq groups often do not share one another s visions and encourage only individuals with fitting views to join their organizations.,"for example, the uk lgbt consortium says that membership is open to groups who support our work and share our values and vision for the sector."
Attack,many other animals exhibit sex specific behaviour and roles without the existence of social ideas of gender p. 1 . this suggests that both anatomical sex and its corresponding social roles are biologically determined.,"humans have rational capacities that animals lack. therefore, our behaviour is not solely determined by our biological impulses and so, can be socially constructed."

Attack,"a chicken or cow doesn't have any frame of reference, and hence doesn't know what a good or bad life is. we like to attribute meaning to our own lifes and subsequently, animals lives too. if a chicken does not know what it is like to live in the wilderness then is it suffering inside?","if this argument was true, it would be moral for someone to be raised their whole life in something akin to a prison, as long as it was all they were exposed to, as they would not know there is a better life, but this is clearly false."
Attack,"if the state imposes an environment on its citizens that facilitates those citizens living up to the state's claimed values, this is harmful to the citizens' context integrity unless they happen to already share all the same goals as the state.","interstate dynamics like tarrifs against polluter states like the u.s. and china, state exclusions, or climate clubs are underused in the world."
Attack,"the taliban is almost entirely pashtun , alienating the 58 of the country who are not.","this was once the case, but the taliban is evolving to compete. since 2008 the taliban began to portray themselves as multiethnic and since 2014 they began recruiting ethnic tajiks, uzbeks, turkmen, and even shiite muslim hazaras."

Attack,colonizing mars provides an opportunity to innovate in radical ways.,"any mars colony would be dependent on earth, for example for supplies. this would limit its ability to become a test ground for innovations."

Attack,turkey is making significant progress to combat gender inequality.,figures show that the murders of women have been rising for the last three years.

Attack,there is no scientific evidence for a maximally great being.,"the existence of the universe either suggests the existence of a non contingent being greater than the universe, or that the universe itself is non contingent. it appears as though the universe began, which would suggest that it is contingent."
Attack,"millimeter wave technology can expand the resolution of satellite images , so balloons may not be needed for high resolution imaging.",comparable technology can be applied in balloons as well; balloons will always have a greater capacity for high resolution images than satellites because they are significantly closer to the earth .
Attack,"if we, for example, define god as the manifestation of the entire universe and everything and everyone in it, then this claim is perfectly in line with rationality.",this semantic switch creates a claim no one will disagree with. it's a bit like how if we define evolution as variations of existing genes within a population no one will deny it.
Attack,"according to article 21 of the universal declaration of human rights, the will of the people should be the basis of the authority of government and should be expressed in periodic and genuine elections.",the universal declaration of human rights is aspirational only and not binding on monarchies.

Support,"testing a theory does not require that an actual test be conducted. a theory is tested when a prediction is made by that theory, and the existing or future evidence is analysed to be consistent with that prediction.","darwin's theory predicted that there should be fossils which are transitional or intermediate species . this prediction was made prior to any fossil evidence of transition species having been found. as more fossils were found, they have been analysed to test the prediction and the theory and the prediction has been eventually proven to be correct."
Attack,"eating meat is also in some case a way to preserve species created by humans, and which can not survive without us. such as in france: béarnaise, pie noire bretonne.",yes but as a delicacy. we don't need to breed 'this many' in order to preserve the species.

Attack,no other country sends as many tourists to israel as the united states; american tourists make up one quarter of all tourism arrivals in israel and contribute to one third of tourism revenue.,the us is one of the most populous countries in the world; the number of arriving tourists is bound to be high in any country visited by americans.
Attack,"it has not been proven that this method is the only way to arrive at the truth of a deity's existence. therefore, it cannot be used to definitively speak until it is established that it is authoritative on all truth.","it should not be taken that the point of this discussion is to limit how a person arrives at what they believe to be the truth. however, this discussion focuses on if theism atheism is justified by scientific methodology."
Attack,"hamas is a revolutionary group resisting israeli occupation. it aims to achieve a free and peaceful palestine, not the destruction of jews.",hamas has been classified by the eu and the us as a terrorist organization rather than a resistance group.

Support,consuming pornography can be beneficial and justified as a form of entertainment for mature audiences.,"media consumption has a somewhat abstract relationship to ethics. it is difficult, perhaps impossible, to draw a clear connection between the act of seeing and personal culpability or responsibility for what one sees."
Attack,steroid users who have an audience and lie about their use make people believe that they can look like them without steroids. this deception can be harmful.,"the concealment of steroid use by influencers would likely only support motivating their audience to engage in extensive healthy exercise and diet, helping them reach goals like healthy physiology, diet, and exercise."

Support,"the sources for roman and greek history are usually biased and removed one or two generations or even centuries from the events they record. yet, historians reconstruct with confidence the course of roman and greek history. therefore, for the gospels to be legends, the rate of legendary accumulation would have to be unbelievable. more generations would be needed.","adding a time gap of two generations to jesus s death lands you in the second century, just when the apocryphal gospels begin to appear. these do contain all sorts of fabulous stories about jesus, trying to fill in the years between his boyhood and his starting his ministry, for example. these are the obvious legends sought by the critics, not the biblical gospels."
Attack,the political and financial mismanagement is underscored by the rise in protests in the uk over the past decade.,"the uk has a rich history of protests. thus the existence of protests is not the exception, but the norm."
Attack,the malthusian theory predicts a sustained increase in human population growth rates over time.,malthusian theory has been repeatedly discredited by innovations in farming and food production. there is no reason to think innovation will stop.

Support,"the right of self defense is not inalienable, since a government may violate an individual's rights, it in good faith, on behalf of the state's greater interests.",there are a number of grounds upon which a citizen cannot rely upon self defense in a court of law. these exceptions are so subjective and numerous as to make self defense not inalienable as a right.

Attack,fair trade products help promote sustainable farming and have a positive impact on the environment.,"given that fair trade products cannot be grown in the uk or eu , they have to travel a great distance to get to their end consumer; shipping cargo has an inherent negative impact on the environment."
Attack,"the 2nd law of thermodynamics states that all things fall toward decay in a closed system, unless an outside force acts within the system. in our universe, the outside force would be god.","the second law of thermodynamics makes no claim about decay and disorder, but rather about entropy . entropy in the universe is increasing, consistent with the law of thermodynamics."
Support,feminists commonly use nudity to draw attention to causes they feel would otherwise be overlooked or ignored by society at large.,"vulva activism , a feminist movement, aims to end the stigma attached to genitalia typically associated with women. their viewpoint is that the vulva is not immoral or shameful and should be proudly displayed by anyone who so desires."

Attack,"in some minors with gender dysphoria, their symptoms are temporary and resolve during puberty , negating the need for permanent procedures.","there is no proven way to identify individuals for whom gender dysphoria is temporary and likely to resolve during puberty. until such an assessment is developed, each individual should have the right to opt for gender affirming procedures."

Support,gillick competence is a criterion healthcare professionals use to determine whether a child can meaningfully consent to a medical procedure. this same criterion can be used for gender affirming procedures.,gillick competence is inextricably linked to the bodily autonomy of children. excluding gender affirmation surgery from the purview of this criterion essentially denies transgender children this right.
Attack,"the right of abortion must always be given, as long as it does not threaten the mother's health, regardless of the person's reasons.",the entire purpose of the law is to ensure that an individual's right to live their life as they choose does not impact anyone else's freedom and right to live their lives as they choose. abortion takes away someone else's right to live and to make choices when they are capable of doing that in the future.

Attack,"the setup of the american health system means the cost of sports injuries is not borne by society, but instead athletes are covered by team or university insurance plans, or the athlete themselves bears the high costs of recovery.","given that most college football programs already lose money they will not be able to pay the costs of adequate medical care. thus, these costs will be covered by society."

Support,this is false. condorcet voting methods can and do fail to elect condorcet winners due to strategic voting. for more detail on this: rangevoting.org,"in fact, in a variety of mixtures of both honest and strategic voters, approval and score voting are even more condorcet than condorcet methods themselves! scorevoting.net"

Support,shimei probably could not have gone from jerusalem to gath and back again on a donkey in a 24 hour day with enough time left to be executed.,"jerusalem is 22.4 miles away from gath, but donkeys only walk at 4 miles per hour . this is over 10 hours even without accounting for the weight on the donkey and when assuming the donkey is walking constantly with no breaks."
Attack,"if reformed epistemology is correct, this leads to radical relativism. if belief in any god can be properly basic, the just any belief, it is alleged, such a linus belief in the great pumpkin, can also be properly basic.","with respect to warrant, belief in the great pumpkin is not implied by plantinga s epistemology to be properly basic. just because certain beliefs are properly basic with respect to warrant in no way implies that any arbitrarily selected belief is also warranted in this way."
Support,leprechauns as a coherent concept would give us some prima facie warrant for thinking they could possibly exist. this would not lead to them being proven to exist.,an ontological argument for leprechauns would look like this:

Support,political correctness distorts the social sciences by contributing to the erasure of inconvenient truths.,"conflict theory, or marxism , states that society is dominated by a class of bourgeois. in the opinion of many political correctness advocates, however, the source of social discord is a general disposition among white people to repress other races."
Attack,"there can be no evidence for transcendent realities. by definition, such realities are beyond evidence.","there are arguments for god s existence that do not assume anything about god s attributes, including his transcendence. versions of the kalaam cosmological argument, leibniz s cosmological argument, and teleological argument are good examples."
Attack,"most people are absolutely fine using services that do not e2e encrypt data. look at the popularity of snapchat, instagram, twitter, facebook messenger, gmail and email in general.","facebook announced in 2019 that their new messenger will work across whatsapp, instagram, and facebook, and will be e2e encrypted."

Attack,"some scientists and philosophers consider ideas of simulated reality or similar as not completely unlikely and there are ideas for experimentally investigating associated hypotheses. in late 2022 , a list of potential tests may inspire further thought on potential tests.","there are remarks these experiments would be likely boring and a waste of effort and without any valuable results, or extremely dangerous . the experiments proposed are not necessarily likely to find evidence even if a 'simulation' or something similar is an sufficiently accurate description of the universe."
Support,"a ubi would enhance entrepreneurship, sustaining people while they develop projects that may take time to generate profits.",ubi means that those looking to start new businesses or become self employed can do so without the risk of losing the ability to pay for living costs. this allows for trial and error with relative safety for budding entrepreneurs.

Attack,"political correctness encourages civility in society, and as such enables discourse.",political correctness is a barrier to social change.
Support,barely anyone outside of buddhist temples and monasteries lives according to a buddhist diet.,buddhism's basic code of ethics for laypeople the five precepts does not contain any dietary restrictions but merely prohibits the active participation in killing. outside of temples and monasteries a vegetarian diet is thus not required from buddhists.
Support,positive reinforcement uses dogs' natural desires to facilitate training.,"as dogs are driven by food and play, these incentives work best for training."
Attack,different groups within this state would still have an interest in privately owning such weapons in order to ensure their interests are not overlooked or undermined by the one world state.,"while true, it is unlikely that the impetus to own weapons in the one world state will be comparable to the motivations that countries have in the status quo, and the net amount of weapons will still likely be reduced."
Support,"many people consider it is more important that couples share the same values, regardless of whether they have the same religion or not.",people are more likely to marry outside of their families' religious denominations than outside of their political affiliation the choice of which tends to indicate the values an individual deems important.
Attack,"circumcision marks a jewish child as one of god's chosen, meaning the decision to not circumcise would have risks involved. even if the risks are merely perceived, they cannot be overlooked.",the unsustained perceived risk of being condemned by god for not removing part of a boy's penis is not equivalent to the genuine risk of the unnecessary operation.
Attack,emotions do not provide evidence for the existence of free will because human beings are bound by their emotions.,"psychological research indicates that human beings can willfully regulate their emotions, which supports the existence of free will."
Attack,"psychological distance or zooming out improves decision making p. 659 . for this reason, guardians may be less likely to be swayed by emotion and lose objectivity due to greater separation from the decision.","psychological distance can be induced in the same person making the decision. thus, healthcare professionals can employ these psychological principles to ensure that minors make better decisions."
Support,"many people do not have equal access to traditional degrees, and therefore online degrees should be valued just the same.",the possibility to study online will offer more people more chances to get a high skilled job.
Attack,a positive moral action is one that produces a net benefit.,"a net benefit is hard to define. in fact, there are many actions that can create a net benefit for one's self at the expense of other individuals, or society as a whole. for example, successfully robbing a bank might significantly benefit myself while leaving others in financial hardship."
Attack,"in the us, the educational system is not helping students improve , so the system needs to be revamped anyway.",introducing one reform does not make it easier to introduce others.
Support,the welfare state does not succeed in fighting inequality.,"there is a huge welfare state in western countries, but still a concentration of wealth."
Support,one's species is not a relevant trait when it comes to assessing the value of an animal's life.,the value of a life can only be assessed by the individual who is living it.
Support,a socialist economy would raise the quality of life of a country.,state socialism would reduce intermediaries middle men and their prices of products would decrease since the state owned the means of production would be not for profit.
Attack,"continuous assessment ensures there is less stress on students, as there is no single, high stakes exam they must pass.","continuous assessment could harm students' academic performance, which could lead to them feeling stressed, anxious, or inadequate p. 18 ."
Attack,making voting mandatory would expand the power of political elites and existing governments.,compulsory voting reduces corruption from elected officials.
Attack,"it says as though with a compass , a tool used to draw 2d circles.",the original hebrew of proverbs 8:27 doesn't mention a compass at all.
Support,"given that most societies are patriarchal , the hierarchical structures of islam entrench and reinforce cultural and social forces which oppress women.","although the qur'an promotes equality for women, the interpretation of islamic doctrine is greatly influenced by the hadith, which are a direct product of patriarchal society and values ."
Attack,"at least on social media, the dangerous posts of politicians do not receive the clout or prestige that comes with publishing their opinions in major newspapers.",americans do not have particularly high trust in major media outlets. 2019 saw the number of people who trust mass media decline to 41 percent.
Attack,following tradition is not an acceptable reason for implementing laws as some historical traditions are morally and ethically reprehensible p. 9 .,"humans are born in a nude state. hence, it is our most natural state and therefore cannot be considered morally or ethically reprehensible."
Attack,"parents who have raised their children have an intimate, unique, and accurate knowledge of their needs, likes, and dislikes. they are therefore likely to be particularly capable of choosing their child a highly compatible partner.",due to the fact parents have a close relationship with their children they might be convinced that they know their child better than the child itself and in effect unwilling to listen to the child needs that they don't see as fitting.
Support,"such a ban would be an infringement of people's freedom of religion, which is a fundamental human right.","religious expression is, whether in practice or in choice of clothing, the very measure of a free society."
Support,"keeping ai closed source allows for the implementation of robust safety measures before deployment, reducing the risk of accidents causing death or harm.",choosing not to release an ai to the public before safety measures are implemented is not an option for the open source community; the public can't keep things out of its own hands.
Attack,"according to a european social survey ess , respondents from across europe in the countries included in the survey are inclined to think that there is little they can do on a personal level to mitigate climate change, and that they do not expect others in the world or governments to take effective action against climate change.",nearly nine in ten believe it is important for their national government to set targets to increase renewable energy use and provide support for improving energy efficiency by 2030.
Support,both science and religion search for objective truth about the human condition and the reality in which we exist.,"they are not only compatible, but codependent and symbiotic, because science seeks to quantify and articulate the human experience by providing working theories about how the universe works, while religion searches for the answer to why it all exists in the first place."
Support,the grandparent claim doesn't implicitly or explicitly rely on any mind being too ignorant to come to such a conclusion for any longer than a fraction of a second.,"it only makes a claim about what should rationally be done at the very beginning, before the very basic reasoning that would lead virtually all rational minds to the 5 conclusion."
Attack,"the parent is equivalent of saying, because god may will very little, he has little power. this makes god s power equivalent to the amount of volition he actually exercises and thus misrepresents the original definition. the original definition simply says that an omnipotent being would be able to make anything that it wills come to pass. no sufficient reason has been offered why this is a poor definition of omnipotence.","because following that definition, if a being capable of lifting a rock willed it to be so and willed nothing else it would qualify as being omnipotent."
Support,the newer films in the franchise have been arguably far more criticised by fans and critics alike.,"star wars: the last jedi was criticised by fans for being too progressive, too unexpected, and too dismissive of fan theories."
Attack,we may be the objects in a computer simulation or computer game executed by god.,"if we're sims, then we are patterns, not substance and this fails to account for the possibility that any given observer moment has been simulated multiple times by possibly different beings. since we're patterns and not souls, there's no fact of the matter about which one you are. any interventions by the simulators would only affect one simulation, so statistically you should not expect to observe any miracles. i.e. they have no power to affect us. why then, should we call any simulator god?"
Attack,the same amount of time means less to an adult than a child as time appears to pass more quickly when you re older.,perceiving time as passing by more quickly bares no impact on its value. if anything the value would only increase as life becomes fleeting.
Support,"companies have historically held each other to a higher standard, such as microsoft suing lindows for having a similar name to their flagship software, and nintendo's extensive history of delisting fan content .","even recently, getty images has sued stabilityai for refusing to license their images for ai training ."
Support,the contradictions pointed out in the bible have been criticized as a misinterpretation of the context of the text.,"the law of non contradiction relies on proving that the same author has made two apparently contradictory points. however, research points to the bible having several human authors, in which case the bible would be a compilation of different perspectives rather than a set of contradictions emanating from the same source."
Attack,the 1988 hamas charter explicitly supports antisemitic ideologies and conspiracy theories.,"the hamas charter, like all founding documents, likely represents radical views that do not currently reflect the current organisation."
Attack,"given that we cannot be sure that a god exists, we should not base our understandings of sex and gender on religious beliefs.","many people believe that a god exists. for them, religion is a reliable way to make determinations about how the world ought to be."
Support,"if school is mandatory, parents with concerns about the negative social aspects of school can choose to homeschool their children.","there continue to be frequent school shootings in the us, so home schooled children are safer."
Attack,"gender already lacks social utility, as it is commonly misunderstood and conflated with sex.","unlike gender sex conflation , infinite gender models are neither founded upon scientific inaccuracy nor exclude those lying outside of the gender binary."
Attack,it is more immoral to fight not to help someone and letting him die.,"people might want to help, but voluntarily and in freedom"
Attack,"learning a handful of new, uncomplicated words isn't difficult.","new prominent pronouns keep changing , which makes it difficult to know which one to use."
Attack,there is no justification for assuming a single designer instead of many competing designers. thus this is as much an argument for polytheism.,"the teleological argument never claims to only be applicable to monotheism. if polytheism can use the telelogical argument successfully, then this is evidence for polytheism as well as monotheism. pointing this out isn t necessarily useful for defeating the argument. it is unrelated."
Attack,"unless you are familiar with the means by which human beings can flourish without creating suffering, or you can provide sources, this claim is irrelevant.","the argument is that if we continue searching, we will or may eventually find."
Support,there are many examples of communication causing physical harm.,"speech does not have to emotionally harm someone for it to be damaging. propaganda does not damage someone emotionally, yet most would agree that propaganda which tries to influence people into thinking something contradictory to reality is still damaging to society."
Attack,"although we are morally obligated to help others, this does not mean we should be legally compelled to do so.",many people do not carry out moral obligations they do not immediately see feel or are not aware of; legal mechanisms ensure moral obligations are fulfilled.
Attack,our idea of what we define as evil might be a limited vision of a bigger plan in which evil is a necessary element to its realization.,"since god is taken to be omnipotent, it can never be the case that evil is a necessary instrumental part of reaching a particular goal, since god could simply will the fulfillment of that goal without creating any evil."
Attack,slavery was only one part of the economic issues that caused the civil war.,"while slavery might have been just one issue, it was also the most important issue, as the south's entire economy was based on this institution."
Attack,"no matter what criterion of moral considerability you choose, there is always some overlap between humans and animals in possessing this criterion, so if you exclude animals from being morally considerable, you also exclude some humans.",society has a shared duty to protect infants and the cognitively disabled on the basis of shared species membership. humans owe no such duties to animals.
Support,desires that please one person may demean another. happiness cannot outweigh the life or liberty of another person.,"lesser things would be things which a person can possess. no possession is worth life. by extension, gaining possessions at the cost of another's life would be forbidden."
Attack,the transportation of products across the world is polluting.,"thanks to globalisation, companies do not need to transport their products to other countries. instead, they could partner with local businesses in these countries to set up subsidiaries that can manufacture and or sell their products."
Support,citizens lack the knowledge and skills to draft good laws.,"there are things, such as science, which aren't democratic by their own nature, but have to be accounted during the lawmaking process by experts."
Attack,only having pixel graphics is to completely ignore some amazing video game innovations; we shouldn't be going backwards.,"limitation breeds innovation; some of the most notable expansions of hardware and software is the iconic doom port , which can help reveal new ways that a device can be used ."
Attack,"animals do not have rights at all. they live in a state of eat or be eaten. rights do not exist in the natural world at all, only in the socially constructed world that humans have created for themselves.","even if society did not exist and humans lived in a state of anarchy, it would still be immoral to murder or torture people. this indicates that rights exist independently of social construction."
Attack,"in case of invasion, the state could create militias by giving training and weapons to the community.","this would be the creation of a de facto military force, and is different from allowing private individuals to own guns outside of wartime."
Attack,companies save and profit off of every cent not paid to a woman that would be paid to her male colleagues.,paying women less than men makes businesses look bad to customers . this should incentivize companies to prioritize equality and diversity.
Attack,"while negative for the individual, high infant death rate is part of the evolutionary process and allowing weaker infants to survive weakens the gene pool of that species.",enabling weak infants to survive increases the gene pool in endangered species with few breeding individuals.
Support,home schooled children are less likely to play sports than traditionally schooled children.,"specifically participating in sports as a child or adolescent is associated with improved self esteem and confidence, and reduced depressive symptoms."
Support,"warmer winters allow pests to flourish, reducing crop yields.",changes in weather have enabled insects to expand their migratory routes and establish themselves as pests within a single year.
Attack,"brain size doesn't necessarily mean more intelligence. the sperm whale for instance has a brain that weighs 17 lbs on average , where a normal humans is 3 lbs. that doesn't mean sperm whales are smarter than humans.","brain size on its own is meaningless, but brain size in proportion to body size is a consistent index of animal intellectual development"
Support,"sexual orientation can be understood as the result of a complex combination of one s genes, environment, and hormones p.1",epigenetic changes can induce changes in sexual orientation. an entity's sexual orientation is the result of its hormonal environment.
Attack,"because animals feel, they should be treated according to utilitarian ethics , which advocates maximising pleasure and minimising suffering for all sentient beings.",many animals are incapable of feeling pain. depending on the definition of sentient this may not be able to be applied to meat from any source in general.
Support,an opt in or opt out policy can be made for families that support this practice.,"families that opt in likely use corporal punishment at home already. as such, the application of corporal punishment in schools would offer no unique consequence."
Attack,the state has a moral obligation to fight inequality.,it's impossible to protect individual liberty and equality simultaneously. people's intrinsic right to liberty can't be stripped in the promotion of equality.
Support,there is a large ethnic russian and russian speaking population in donbas.,russian is the main language of 70 75 of residents.
Support,giving ex convicts jobs reduces the likelihood of them re offending.,"a job gives a sense of purpose and belonging, which gives people a reason to want to stay out of prison."
Attack,"subsequent generations will automatically be socialized into a different lifestyle, normalizing the changes and sacrifices made by the prior generation.",lifestyle trends change significantly from generation to generation.
Support,"politicians in democracies are ultimately answerable to the public, which votes them into power.",citizens in the west have a lot of power as consumers and voters to shape a more sustainable future.
Attack,public funding is unlikely to be allocated fairly across political parties.,"this is dependent on the system of allocation, and countries such as norway have developed systems to allocate money based on popularity and membership."
Attack,"it is unclear whether his managerial style showed good judgment, as there were two completely different stories on the goings on in the white house. a negative picture was painted by anonymous people or people with little credibility , while a positive picture was painted by everyone else who worked or had worked there.","there were three different sources for the conflict and turmoil in the white house the book , the opinion article , and omarosa ."
Support,genetically modified food is often subject to more rigorous safety checks than its non gm counterparts .,"genetically modified crops can only be grown if they are approved for use by the appropriate regional agency, who will only do so if there is scientific evidence that they will not harm the environment or people."
Support,"p1. the concept of a a maximally great being is intuitively a coherent notion . therefore, we have some prima facie warrant for thinking that a maximally great being is possible.","in order for the ontological argument to fail, the concept of a maximally great being must be incoherent, like the concept of a married bachelor. it is not an incoherent idea."
Attack,"the prime minister , his cabinet and public prosecutors are amongst the 10,000 public figures granted this legal status from the spanish judicial system. this is not a special privilege solely awarded to the monarchs.","however, politicians and public figures lose their condition of aforados once they cease their functions. that is not the case of the former king who, moreover, retains total immunity for any past actions."
Attack,"better relations between israel and the palestinians would weaken iran, one of the principal adversaries of the united states and israel, which has long used hezbollah and hamas as proxies .",iran does not depend on the israeli oppression of palestinians in order to exert its influence in the region.
Attack,"there are many things that people do that have negative impacts on the environment which we would not want to complete stop doing. for example, farming plants and trees, mining for construction, manufacturing of consumer electronics, etc. the negative impacts on the environment of farming animals is not a sufficient reason for the contention that all meat consumption should stop.","other wrongdoings don't justify this wrongdoing. we may not be ready to abandon things like mining or tree cutting, but abandoning meat consumption is doable without negative impact in technological advancement."
Support,a similarly devastating attack would likely require chemical or nuclear weapons.,the resources necessary to produce or acquire such weapons precludes non state actors from acquiring them.
Support,this is never the reason given by those practicing it and sometimes just the opposite .,"in elective genital cosmetic surgery removing genital tissue from the clitoris glans reduction, prepuce is performed to enhance sexual enjoyment."
Support,the lack of progress in the conflict between israel and palestine could cause a third intifada as people are increasingly frustrated with the status quo.,both the first intifada and second intifada were direct results of israeli occupation of the west bank and the gaza strip. recognizing palestine might be a step toward preventing this from happening again.
Support,the public could push the supply and demand wheel in favour so that there are large incentives to become a teacher on a coding courses.,"if students with javascript or php experience had access to post graduation programs that non tech students did not, then the demand for coding class would increase."
Attack,"according to alvin plantinga , theism, that is the belief in god, is a properly basic belief and instinctual belief, and should thus not necessarily require justification, just like a belief in the existence of the outside world, or in other minds. if he is right, it is atheism that requires justification, not theism.","belief in the outside world and in other minds via the rejection of solipsism does require justification. the justifications being the general static state of reality and the inability to verify data without some for of observation renders those points effectively moot, beyond acknowledging their possibility."
Attack,reforming transgender individuals' access to bathrooms aligns with the civil rights movements for equal bathroom access that other marginalised groups have experienced.,"improving access for one marginalized group should not come at the cost of another marginalized group. notably, women one of the marginalized groups in society p. 1 have restricted bathroom access ; gender neutral bathrooms could exacerbate these restrictions."
Attack,"making fake news illegal would encourage content creators to fact check more comprehensively to avoid falling foul of the law. as a result, the proliferation of fake news will be reduced.",people who write and publish fake news stories are deliberately spreading misinformation and are not interested in fact checking at all.
Support,"the fact that human beings are capable of making choices and taking steps to overcome their circumstances, preferences, cravings, urges, and desires is evidence that free will exists.","the simple exercise of suppressing an innate desire, such as choosing not to snack when feeling hungry, supports the idea that there actually is free will."
Support,creating animals that don't feel pain is a challenging process in which success cannot be guaranteed.,the research necessary to genetically modify animals would be costly and better allocated to other more pressing issues.
Support,there is no us policy that would be effective against climate change; climate change is inevitable.,research shows that sharp and potentially devastating temperature rises of 3 to 5 degree celsius in the arctic are inevitable even if the world succeeds in cutting greenhouse gas emissions in line with the paris agreement .
Support,gradually reducing the work year e.g. start with 2 more vacation days a year gives time for the economy to adjust.,"giving workers additional holiday time would be compensation for their increased productivity over the past 50 years , which has not been compensated with wage increases."
Support,"fptp violates the spirit of one person, one vote .","if there are more than two candidates, no vote has an anti vote in the system. the system does not accord equal power to a supporter of a candidate as to a voter who opposes that candidate and supports all the others. therefore, it violates one person, one vote ."
Attack,pollution caused by grazing damages river systems.,rotational grazing can help reduce damage to river systems without abandoning animal agriculture entirely p. 2118 .
Support,"fairtrade co operatives are required to meet costly quality and certification standards, which means their farmers must be relatively skillful, educated, and generally well funded.","countries ranked by the world bank as upper middle income contain 54 of all producer organisations that have fairtrade certification. in comparison, low income countries contain only 21 of fairtrade producers."
Attack,"linguistics is a product of and shaped by communities, so popular opinion is a strong basis upon which to define something.","language is always changing . if enough people deem a hot dog can be called a sandwich, the it should go by that popular sentiment."
Support,jesus resurrected and then ascended into heaven. there is a distinct difference.,there is no known corpse of jesus to evidence a normal death.
Support,"for morality to be objective it would have to be inter subjectively testable, as karl popper argued . morality is not intersubjectively testable in this way.","to claim morality is objective, one would need to first identify an innate human quality which properly identifies the moral value of any action. this faculty would be quite unlike any faculty of perception that we know humans have, so it is unlikely that we could find one."
Attack,"even when provided with clear evidence that teaching methods based on learning styles theory are ineffective, one third of educators indicated that they would continue to use such methods p. 8 .","while learning styles theory lst is flawed, students will still have different kinds of personalities and interests, and thus still prefer different kinds of instruction varied instruction has also been shown to be motivating for students in it self. it is possible that teachers continue using methods inspired by lst because they're noticing these benefits."
Support,"even though some doctrines are incompatible, religion doesn't contradict empirical evidence necessarily, which would be necessary for religion to be incompatible with science.",the doctrines of religions can be understood as metaphors to explain scientific events.
Support,"regardless of their size, bathrooms can be easily and efficiently cleaned as long as they have individual stalls; this will ensure that patrons still have access to stalls other than the one being cleaned.","individual stalls can continue to be used while others are cleaned. while this may temporarily slow down access, it will have less of an impact that closing the entire bathroom."
Support,some religious groups advocate homeschooling as a way of ensuring children adopt the same religious views.,nearly 60 of respondents to a 2014 survey of homeschooled alumni agreed that their family had been fundamentalist.
Attack,"many married men are actively involved in duties similar to priestly duties in their role as part time deacons , suggesting that if they were allowed to become priests they would be interested.","many deacons may not be interested in becoming a priest, as they may prefer keeping their current full time job and maintaining their part time deacon duties over becoming a full time priest."
Attack,"propaganda is an immensely useful historical source . it reveals which ideologies were promoted, and to whom, and correspondingly tells us about the agenda of powerful people. it also provides clues about what its intended recipients thought and believed.","we can only get these benefits from a source once it is possible to verify that it is in fact propaganda. without a historically reliable account to compare the piece to, there is no way of knowing whether or not it exaggerates or sensationalises claims."
Support,monarchs in some democratic countries only allowed democracy when confronted with plausible threats of violence or supported undemocratic regimes.,"declassified documents and the undisclosed identity of the coup leader codenamed white elephant , which some authors claim could have been former king juan carlos, suggest he was not in favour of democracy but actually supported the coup."
Attack,"joining the eu has been shown to impose restrictions, which is one of the main reasons for brexit occurring.",see discussion 8708: the uk should remain in the eu if a hard brexit is the only alternative option.
Support,"facts must be sensed and interpreted to be documented by science. human senses and perception can be flawed, resulting in misunderstandings of reality.",human senses are fallible and are not calibrated in a way that supports objective measurement p. 149 .
Support,"the proposed laws would nonetheless limit the firearms available to even a law abiding, responsible person.",waiting periods and magazine capacity bans inhibit citizens from protecting themselves.
Attack,"...he fought for those ideas because they were more or less democratically voted upon. this gets dangerously close to the nazi defense at nuremburg reference , analysis .","this is an ad hominem either guilt by association or poisoning the well . the fact that the nazis used a similar defense does not make any statement about the defense or r.e.l. it would be like saying: nazis filed paperwork in service to the reich, which is dangerously close to what many americans do today..."
Support,"the story of jesus's crucifixion was detailed enough to believe that when jesus was pronounced dead, that it was accurate due to the injuries sustained. therefore confirmation bias wouldn't play a role.",confirmation bias concerning the injuries sustained would lend itself to a state of disbelief if someone had declared that jesus had risen from the dead.
Attack,"adopting other cultures for enjoyment is not harmful and may lead to important diverse innovations in music, food, architecture, fashion, art, and more.","people can enjoy many things, therefore it is not clear that the joy that comes from appropriative innovation is a good heuristic for evaluating use."
Support,humans make the most valuable contributions to the world and therefore should be valued above animals.,"we are dependent on our cooperation for survival and advancement, and as long as it is that way, we will value humans above animals."
Attack,the transformation in the lives and traditions of the disciples supports the resurrection.,this could be caused by a belief in a resurrection even if the resurrection didn't actually happen.
Attack,1 people experienced appearances of jesus after his death.,"the accounts of post death appearances are unreliable because they are secondary sources that were typically sketchy and were written many years later , not accounts by the witnesses themselves."
Support,"mandatory schooling ensures students have the opportunity to develop critical thinking skills, enabling them to effectively reason, make decisions, and solve problems.",schooling encourages fact based problem solving and analysis; making it mandatory affords children more time in which to hone these skills.
Support,the ontological argument shows that there must be some being that has the properties traditionally ascribed to god. we can't abandon those properties and still be talking about that being.,"if we abandon elements of god's perfection, then god would no longer be that which nothing greater can be imagined, because the thing with all perfections would still be imaginable and greater."
Support,corporations do not create jobs merely because they have extra cash. that contention is logically absurd.,"the most significant driver of jobs comes from demand outpacing supply capacity . capturing greater market share means profits, the quintessential motivator in capitalism."
Support,"instead of revising the existing legislation on monogamous marriage, a new category for polygamous relationships could be introduced, including components that address to the unique issues presented by these relationships.",much of the criticism could be met by making polygamous marriages different in terms of family law.
Attack,"zoos often function as hospitals and hospices for animals that are considered particularly difficult or complex to care for. if such animals are injured, sick, or in need of surgery, zoos provide care for them.","most zoos asked to take on animals irresponsibly or illegally purchased in the exotic animal trade are not equipped to look after such animals, so most of these animals are instead euthanized."
Support,"transhumanism might have unforeseen dangers, because it has never been accomplished on a mass scale.","it can negatively affect our evolution on a long term, especially if it applies to newborns. transhumanism can cause irreversible changes if we do not take extra care each step of the way."
Attack,tolerance is increasing with each generation in the usa.,crimes against jewish americans increased by over 37 in 2016.
Attack,a welfare state is an acknowledgement of a broken economic model rather than a solution in itself.,"in an economy with huge number of people, it's impossible to expect welfare to naturally arrive from the interactions. thus, the greater the economic system is, the more care must be given to keep its citizens in minimal functional conditions, i.e., welfare."
Attack,"with psychological manipulation, there is no easier and comparably effective alternative to learning about the relevant areas of human psychology. thus people intending to harmfully manipulate people will learn about it, unofficially or officially. long term there is little difference, they will largely know the same things either way just as well.",most people spewing misinformation on twitter x for example never learned about psychology.
Attack,women are more than 10 times less likely to be in prison compared to men,judges are predisposed to be harsher on a convicted male than a female that has committed the same crime.
Attack,an anarchist society would be characterized by extreme inequality.,inequality is not intrinsically bad. the poor in an anarchist society can be richer than in a society that has an equal distribution of less wealth and a government . unequally rich is better than equally impoverished.
Support,"sikhism does not place many restrictions on its adherents' lifestyles, such as dress or diet p. 20",restrictions on recreational substances are often interpreted leniently by sikhs.
Attack,"at certain times in history, obesity was considered attractive, as it was a symbol of wealth and status . we should not assume that our current values are correct.","it was considered attractive because it was a sign of wealth. you had to be rich to eat enough to get that fat. nowadays, this is no longer the case, almost anyone can do it. obesity is not a status symbol in the western world."
Attack,this claim makes it explicitly clear that unplanned motherhood causes women to suffer. to want to put unwilling women through suffering for the rest of their lives is inhumane.,"the pro life position does not include want ing women to suffer. pregnant women will suffer in different ways regardless of the legality of abortion i.e. morning sickness, kicking, the pain of childbirth. abortions are certainly not pain free, and the physical and emotional pain that follow are tremendous . the pro life position seeks to protect innocent humans from being killed. killing innocent humans is a much greater evil than the level of suffering that is endured in pregnancy."
Support,laws should only restrict actions that directly violate the individual rights of others. not voting does not limit anyone else s rights.,"according to libertarian political philosophy , laws are justified when they protect individual liberties and the pursuit of happiness."
Attack,the cost of attending a university makes students more accountable to their work. they work harder because they paid for it.,paying an excessive amount for higher education makes students more depressed than accountable.
Attack,"gmos are often more cost effective than unmodified foods. as such, it might be easier to make these foods more readily available in countries facing hunger problems.","despite the increased adoption of genetically modified crops in recent years, any sustained reduction in cost has not been passed on to consumers."
Attack,"the women also brought spices to embalm jesus's body on easter morning luke 24:1 , which means they also expected jesus's body to rot.","women were generally illiterate and excluded from scriptural discussion, so the fact that they did not interpret the scriptures to predict jesus' rise is entirely predictable."
Attack,claiming an event known to have happened and verified to have happend as an act of special providence is by its very nature unfalsifiable and cannot have any evidence in support of it. it essentially boils down to giving god credit for some event that could be explained by natural means. now this is obviously possible but it adds unnecessary assumptions going against occams razor. this should induce doubt as to the reasonableness or probability that divine providence is an actuality.,"personal testimony combined with an expectation that god would act is adequate evidence for the possibility of a special providence. since there can be evidence for the event, they can be falsified."
Support,many people only have low financial resources. ais will not be accessible to them if costs aren't low which they can be if they can e.g. run the model locally on their own machine or on a web platform that makes the foss model available.,there is huggingface and many other websites making open source ai models available over the web and free apis.
Support,"the rebellion, on the other hand, has revealed areas of weakness for putin, which gives its opponents insight into how to attack his regime.",prigozhin noted that the ease of wagner s advance on moscow exposed 'serious security problems.'
Attack,"fundamentally, capitalism's ideology is make as much money as you can, as fast as you can, as efficiently as you can, which inevitably leads to corruption.","the fundamental ideology of capitalism is adam smith's invisible hand , which is belief in the notion that people given free choice to pursue their self interest in a system of voluntary transactions will optimize for the best of society."
Attack,"the word womxn may be sexist and racist according to some, and the term womyn excludes biological woman . replacing either of the words with female is also derogatory when used offensively. even when a person genuinely tries to educate themselves, and greatly desires not to cause offense, it may be easy to do so inadvertently.",a generally accepted and widely used term is female identifying or identifying as female .
Support,the need for a college degree or trade diploma has increased to where a high school degree was needed in the past.,the principle of 'academic inflation ' argues that the exchange value of a qualification is devalued over time as the market is flooded with comparable candidates.

Attack,the rise of agis is likely to undermine the social and economic fabric of society.,"people have been scared of the health dangers of various technologies in the past. in many cases, these technologies were regulated, and these scares were overcome over time , thus proving beneficial."
Attack,many approaches to transhumanism aren't a step in evolution but a replacement for it.,"transhumanism is a step in evolution, as it is still selection for survival of the fittest. the only difference is that it is artificial and not natural, because humans can now decide their evolutionary path instead of nature."
Support,employers don't take mental health seriously . this exacerbates the stigma.,"being open about mental health conditions could lead to an increase in bullying in the workplace, both by peers and superiors."
Support,there are convincing arguments against god s existence.,"religions contain hypocrisy. god would construct a perfect religion if he existed. therefore, god does not exist."
Support,"many world famous celebrities, including harry styles, elton john, and adele, declined to perform at the coronation event , possibly as a form of protest and ultimately dissuading their fans from attending the event.","celebrities may have declined to perform due to moral reasons. elton john was a close friend of princess diana and performed at her funeral, so some fans believe that he might have been morally opposed to honoring her ex husband and his former mistress in a similar fashion."
Attack,"higher population results in higher workforce. this will allow more industry to grow and bloom, thus resulting in higher return for the country.",infinite growth is neither inevitable nor desirable. let the economy adapt to meet the needs of those already here.
Attack,"the main antagonist, snoke, is a cardboard character. he doesn't have a decent background story and is too powerful. he isn't very charismatic and his motives are flat.","do we really need a background for him? one of the greatest things about the original trilogy is how it plunked viewers down in the middle of a galaxy with history, but only explained what was necessary to the story. when the prequels began explaining things that weren't essential to the plot, the suspension of disbelief vanished. ex. midichlorians"
Attack,"if treated as a civil right, people won't take responsibility for unhealthy behaviors.",most people are naturally deterred from engaging in unhealthy or risky behavior due to a fear of injury or death.
Support,prescribing life skills education at a young age may decrease variation in how children develop life skills.,life skills are heavily informed by individual culture.
Attack,architecture allowed to built cities and improve our quality of life.,a significant part of contemporary architectural work serves the interests of the rich and elite instead of addressing important problems.
Attack,the energy crisis in europe has increased the cost of living by 10.9 .,"once energy prices decrease, the cost of living is likely to stabilize as well."
Attack,international institutions and law provide states with moral guidance.,"there is no enforcer of law and regulation within an anarchic international system , thus any legal principles do not hold significant weight."
Attack,"social species like humans have built in predispositions to share values, which is not incompatible with beliefs in supernatural beings.","humans are incapable of objective perception , and therefore would come up with different conclusions in viewing the same thing, or the same conclusions when viewing entirely different situations."
Support,"ukraine is a historical place for russian identity , so it might not be justified to pull ukraine further away from russia's influence.",the regions of donetsk and luhansk are against ukrainian integration.
Attack,religions teach the existence of an immaterial soul.,there is no scientific evidence to suggest an immaterial soul
Attack,cultural diversity can reduce the efficiency of work.,"where organisations accommodate for their religiously diverse employees, hr professionals report that employee morale improves shrm, p. 11 . this in turn increases productivity ."
Attack,"arranged marriages harm cultural integration, since they most often occur between people of the same social strata, religion or other group.","arranged marriages in the unification church occur between people of different cultures , who often do not speak the same language."
Attack,"star wars needed to break new ground in order to stay relevant, as the force awakens set up a path that mirrored the original trilogy too closely. the last jedi is what star wars needs going forward.","the pre story having been tarnished by the prequels, longtime fans people who viewed the movie during the original release of star wars and who were fans of it had reason to count primarily on the post story of notable middle trilogy characters to be addressed in episodes vii ix."
Attack,"in different religions there are great philosophers who have searched for logic and evidence to draw conclusions and evaluate the religion, supporting precisely reason.","it's plausible that each of these great philosophers did not truly believe, instead choosing to conform only to avoid trouble, and remained unhindered by drawing unfounded assumptions."
Attack,there is nothing wrong with exploring 'alternative explanations' if the explanations in question are backed up by evidence. observing the natural world has garnered the human race information that a belief in a supernatural entity simply doesn't provide.,intelligent design is the best inference to explain the origin of genetic information based on the data youtu.be
Support,historians frequently make use of texts whose authors and origins are unknown.,"the anglo saxon chronicle , one of the most valuable texts for studying early medieval england, was written anonymously. it is also uncertain where and when it was first composed."
Support,many cases where proskuneo does mean worship describe the person bowing down first.,"in acts 10:25 proskuneo does mean worship, and it is preceded by bowing down."
Attack,circumcision may have a negative effect on sexual activity later in life.,a sexual partner has no more right to force their mate into cosmetic alterations to enhance the sexual experience than they do to impose limits on what alterations can be performed due to any supposed potential for a negative sexual experience.
Support,religion has historically been leveraged to achieve the emancipation of women in some places; feminists can emulate this to empower liberatory sects.,feminists in nations like morocco have used religion to reform misogynistic laws that limited the family p. 3 .
Attack,everything that god's followers have are a gift and ultimately belong to god. therefore god has a right to whatever he wants with them. this does not equate to torture.,"implying god's ownership over all his followers reduces the value of job's children to no more than a possession. therefore, it contradicts the concept we are all equally valuable in god's eyes."
Support,surveillance balloons can be used to protect national security interests.,numerous countries utilize surveillance balloons as a means to improve the safety and security of their populace.
Support,"morality is a system of emotional responses , a moral sense , rather than a system that is rationally determined.","thus, morality is not rational and not irrational, but arational, that is, ultimately independent from reason."
Attack,religions like christianity were formed in opposition to popular secular and religious cultures of their times.,christianity reforming to new ideals is not the same as the catholic church reforming.
Attack,"genetic modification is not as quick as its supporters claim, due to limitations inherent to the process, such as unexpected epigenetic changes and or mutations.",epigenetic changes and mutations can occur naturally and thus are not unique to gm organisms.
Support,foreign aid can only be accepted by a somewhat friendly government. the collapse of the current regime and replacement with the taliban would likely mean the end of humanitarian aid.,the taliban has been presenting itself as a legitimate administration in large portions of afghanistan. leaving now would only provide it with more legitimacy as the afghan government would have fewer resources to compete.
Attack,"freedom of speech is a fundamental human right, and should be preserved online.","government regulation could limit social media sites from moderating online content, thus bolstering free speech."
Attack,inequality of outcome is the natural consequence of variations in human intelligence.,wealth inequality can not be attributed to differences in iq and talent as this does not speak to wealth inheritance which accounts for a significant portion of wealth worldwide.
Attack,"the universe we observe has precisely the properties we should expect if there is, at the bottom, no design, no purpose, no evil and no other good. nothing but blind, pitiless indifference. dna neither knows nor cares. dna just is. and we dance to its music. richard dawkins","dawkins specified at the bottom , which allows for the possibility of purpose, evil, and good being non fundamental, emergent properties."
Support,animals have the capacity to suffer in the same way and to the same degree that humans do. the ability of suffering is a vital characteristic that gives a being the right to equal consideration.,animals have neurological functions and capacities to generate consciousness and intentional behaviors. available research concludes that humans are not unique in that regard.
Support,"small scale industries often represent the hard work of the local community in raising money, hiring employees, and generally putting their labour into an enterprise. even if they do not provide a distinct economic value, their loss is culturally tragic.","multinational corporations, in comparison, are distant, foreign, and do not relate to local communities in any meaningful way beyond offering employment."
Support,the problem of consciousness has no satisfactory explanation based on a materialistic world view.,there is no support for the idea that consciousness as an epiphenomenon of matter because there have never been an explanation for the mechanism which gives rise to consciousnesses. the chinese room experiment is an example which demonstrates this conundrum.
Attack,to claim monarchistic institutions should be abolished without considering the complex cultural ramifications is short sighted and potentially damaging to a country's cultural identity.,one can preserve something culturally important without continuing it. preservation is not continuity. abolition of monarchy doesn't erase its history.
Support,many people have found online communities they relate to and can connect with through the content available on tiktok.,many people from minority backgrounds have found fame on tiktok.
Support,publicly funded healthcare is more efficient . systems that ration their care by government provision or government insurance incur lower per capita costs.,"countries with private healthcare systems such as the us, tend to spend more per capita on healthcare than those with public systems."
Support,"mandatory schooling creates an educated population p. 19 , which is vital to maintaining a skilled workforce and increasing the tax base to guarantee future education funding.","there is a strong correlation between education level and income, so those with more schooling are likely to have better paying jobs."
Attack,"cao dai has been heavily influenced by spiritism , including practices, such as the use of ouija boards, for communicating with god and the deceased.",the informational veracity and mental health benefits of mediumship have been demonstrated by a number of studies p. 1 .
Attack,the signers of the declaration of independence were also considered traitors by the british. having their statutes in public doesn't represent an insult to the british either.,"'the signers of the declaration of independence were considered patriots here in the united states, the united states happened to win that war with britain. therefore the british don't have the right to be insulted by our statues, also these statues aren't in britain, they're in the united states. the confederacy lost the war, unlike the previously mentioned situation. therefore the confederacy doesn't have a right to have statues honoring their defeated army's members. losers can't pick."
Support,traditions can and in many cases should be changed or substantially modified over time.,"human cannibalism as well as religious human sacrifices are and were traditions in many parts of the world. for various reasons, people largely agree that these traditions should be removed or at least substantially modified e.g. to animal sacrifices over time. these reasons include but are not limited to concerns relating to human dignity, value of human life, and suffering."
Support,"violence and aggression are recurring themes in most video games, which are conventionally masculine traits and are explicit appeals to male gamers . p. 43",data by istanbul university shows a positive correlation between masculinity and the endorsement of violence. p. 259
Attack,"these services, alongside at least 3 more the so called five eyes , have an internal government open source program.","this service is fairly under utilized, as the most important code has sensitivities which means it cannot be open sourced even within the intelligence community."
Attack,women don't have equal opportunities to have simultaneously a big family and a demanding career.,"it is unclear from this study if this is the result of institutional gender discrimination, social norms customs, or female life choices. without additional study into this, it cannot, and should not, be labelled a lack of equal opportunities or discrimination."
Support,there is no consensus about what reasonable copyright law should be.,the fact that there is no consensus means that any attempt to abolish copyright would likely be mired in disagreement and frequent changes in the new laws adopted.
Attack,"whistleblowing carries several significant risks , which may be particularly pronounced when the exposed party is the government . therefore, receiving a pardon may increase the risk of retaliation for whistleblowers, because of which they may prefer secure incarceration or living in exile.","nsa whistleblower edward snowden has stated that he would prefer to live in his own country rather than in exile. this likely generalizes to all whistleblowers, whose actions are motivated by the desire to better their country at all costs."
Attack,"the actual covid 19 death rate must be estimated based on a calculated excess mortality rate, as not all covid 19 infected persons are being tested, but only a selected subset of them.","based on early reporting figures and adjustments for reporting delays, various countries with significant outbreaks saw significant excess mortality ."
Support,marriage is a harmful institution and should not be supported by the state.,marriage contributes to economic inequality within society. linking benefits to marriage only increases the problem of inequality.
Support,"destroying art we don't like, memorials of those we disagree with and burning books we find subversive is against american values and in line of regimes such as the taliban.",erasing historic landmarks solely based on someone's individual values is similar to the conduct of isis. history may in the future view our generation the same way our current generation views isis's destruction of historic monuments.
Support,"anthropologists have identified many societies where there is a third gender, such as the hijras of india .",there is significant anthropological evidence of a third gender in many native american tribes.
Attack,operational cost do not predict the final cost for the customer. having less competition means the price can go up. market share has a more significant impact on the price than operational cost.,the problem there often are not the mergers and acquisition but the lack of regulations that prevent large profit margins on products and services of public interest such as medicine or electricity below a certain threshold of consumption. there already are competition law that ought to prevent much of this.
Support,the extraction of natural resources from earth will be reversible and temporary.,"even if at first there are some key imports from earth, there will be a huge economic incentive to start producing some resources locally, simply because it will be easier than to transfer those same resources from one planet to another."
Support,"zoos only violate higher order rights, such as the freedom of movement or habitat, which animals do not deserve.","even insofar as animal rights exist, they should not extend to higher order rights which are associated with human socialisation and civilisation."
Attack,political correctness opens discourse and dialogue for members of society who don't feel they are allowed to speak or be heard.,there are no studies that suggest that forcing others to discontinue the use of certain words will open up dialogue. more so the parent claim undermines years of hard work that currently gives these people a platform to talk on.
Attack,the person with the most money buys the most artillery.,"this is about possible insurgent warfare or extreme vandalism if truly needed, not an open battlefield situation."
Support,palestinian territories are not occupied but disputed territories .,"similar territories are recognised as disputed; yet, only the west bank is designated as an occupation."

Support,lived experience and human observation are highly reconstructive and flawed and therefore cannot falsify determinism.,"there is psychological evidence that people often misremember events even just after they happen, which could explain the illusory belief that choice precedes certain actions."
Support,cultures can preserve their practices without compromising them by making vegan substitutions.,"traditional dishes can use vegan alternatives. for example, dishes involving minced meat can use meat alternatives."
Attack,"research suggests a correlation between income, happiness and life satisfaction. income inequality thus translates into inequality of well being p. 1 .","for many, the feelings of inadequacy created by relative poverty are based on the wealth of others being greater, not just a lack of resources . this means that many of the problems of inequality will persist."
Support,simple subjective preference is unable to be a standard for morality.,if there exists even a single objective law then there must be a lawgiver who is the ontological source of that law .
Attack,"objective truth is unattainable, so it would be impossible for anti fake news laws to properly identify fake news.","objective truth doesn't have to be attainable as long as sources are cited and the appropriate distinctions are made between inferences, potentialities, opinions, etc."
Attack,"many medical procedures sound gruesome if described literally, but this does not necessarily mean they are bad.",the second listed definition of the word mutilate reads: to deprive a person or animal of a limb or other essential part.
Support,exaggerations regarding overpopulation aim to make people aware of their negative impact on future generations.,some individuals hype up overpopulation to push forward birth population control agendas to sustain earth's population with the resources available.
Attack,countries that use gendered language have greater gender inequality in society p. 278 .,the causal link may actual be acting in reverse: countries with greater gender inequality may be likelier to use gendered language.
Attack,there is no evidence for any especially tall people in the middle east at that time.,many natural medical conditions can cause gigantism.
Attack,there are laws that require zoos to maintain a certain level of well being for their animals.,all cold blooded animals are excluded from the federal definition of animal.
Support,the carbon tax significantly accelerates the shift away from coal and toward renewable electricity.,"the effects of a carbon tax on prices will be largest for energy produced by coal, followed by oil, then natural gas, due to the difference in carbon intensity of each fuel. this would significantly reduce the economic viability of utilizing each of these resources for energy production gordon, 4 ."
Attack,"foster carers are subject to regular reviews , after they have been approved, to ensure the required criteria are upheld in the long run.","according to the child advocate review, the quality of safety assessments only met standards in 46 of reviewed cases p. 15 ."
Attack,many previous star wars installments include strong female characters and or leads.,"in the original trilogy as well as the prequels, no women fight in any of the light saber duels which embody star wars like few other things."
Attack,inequality of outcome breeds inequality of opportunity.,there is at least anecdotal evidence that equality of opportunity already exists without equality as a starting point.
Support,"science can be incompatible with religion, and religion can still be compatible with science.","science is not self established, and rests on the metaphysical and philosophical aspects that only religion can establish. basically, the kind of knowledge that science is concerned with, may preclude religion. but the kind of knowledge religion is concerned with, does not preclude science, but establishes it"
Attack,"since shareholders ultimately bear the costs of compensating their company's employees, they should be the ones who determine how much each one is paid.","while shareholders may bear the cost for paying those at the top, society bears the cost for ensuring that those at the bottom of the pay scale can also make a living."
Attack,"it's possible to think one religion is closer to the truth than another. thus, religion is not dependent on blind faith without reason.","a religion can either be the truth, or not the truth. it's not possible for a religion to be closer to the truth than another."
Attack,parents must live with their decision and therefore do what is best for their child. every family is different. what is best for one may be totally offensive for another.,"actually parents are not allowed to do whatever they want to their child, even if they think it is for the best of the child. as sad as it is, sometimes society must step in to protect the child from his her own parents. laws haven been already created to protect the children from many other forms of violence by their parents."
Support,many other places in the world accept enormous amounts of immigrants and can still do well.,"london, which has around 30 per cent immigrants, is a place where everyone wants to be at, and has much higher wages and lower unemployment compared to australia."
Support,the palestinian economy has seen a trajectory of strong growth in the past despite massive challenges. this demonstrates an economic dynamism that would make it unlikely to collapse into a failed state.,gdp growth in palestine is expected to return to 3.5 in 2021.
Support,"averting climate change would require overcoming political barriers, spending millions or billions of dollars, and a long time frame; we should focus on adaptation as a short term solution instead.",averting climate change would require an immense amount of resources and expensive changes to a number of essential industries.

Attack,"insulin resistance is a metabolic syndrome that occurs after a human consumes too many carbohydrates over their lifetime, which leads to many chronic diseases.","according to the national institute of diabetes, the exact cause of insulin resistance isn't understood but scientists think the major contributors to insulin resistance are excess weight and physical inactivity. there's no solid evidence that insulin resistance is caused by too many carbohydrates ."
Support,"many high income countries profit from conflict in low income countries by supplying weapons and supplies to militant groups, which enables violence and contributes to refugee crises.",the invasion of afrin in syria by turkey has been conducted using a lot of german manufactured weapons.
Attack,"they can give the child up for adoption, thus giving him her a chance at life with a stable set of parents. this is a better option than aborting.",caring for a disabled child may require large investments to improve the child's quality of life. only someone loving the child would be willing to sacrifice a large sum of one's own money.

Attack,"self replicating drones are a dangerous concept for long term sustainability, since code can degrade over time, a digital form of cancer is bound to happen and be unable to safely account for no matter how sufficiently advanced a species is.",one can use things like hashing and reproducible builds concepts to prevent errors. a more durable method of code is not unlikely to be feasible for civilizations that underwent millennia or even millions of years of further technological development than humans.
Support,most people are concerned or uncomfortable when someone uses dark humour.,"dark humour often makes light of serious issues such as self harm and death, which are serious topics that make most other people uncomfortable. it is not appropriate to discuss them so flippantly."
Support,"if recognised as a legitimate state by the us, palestine would be able to directly participate in international organizations such as the un and the world bank.","although israel does not recognise palestine, statehood would allow palestine to appear before the international court of justice to resolve any international disputes peacefully."
Attack,god's own word states that his ways and his people are foolishness to those who reject him.,this is a confusion of the meaning of this passage. god necessary faculties i.e. omnipotency are not equivalent to god's ways choices actions or god's chosen people .
Attack,freedom of expression may be limited in certain cases.,banning hateful instances of religious expression can be accomplished without a complete ban on religious expression.
Support,"private companies play a foundational role in the economy; therefore, the government must protect them and bail them out if necessary.","private companies contribute towards the state's revenue by paying high taxes , and thus deserve to be bailed out."
Support,"in its current form, gmo labelling is not an effective way of informing consumers.",the public are not necessarily already aware of the potential pros and cons of gm foods. simply labelling products to signal gmo presence is therefore insufficient to ensure informed buying choices are made.
Attack,a study claims that almost no unmarried couples who have children stay together.,"says the marriage foundation. this finding, already by the name of its sponsor, is biased."
Support,only when the propagation rates of viruses are coupled with their corresponding death rates per infected person is it possible to compare their dangerousness .,"if the rate of spread alone was used as a measure of risk , hiv could be seen as less dangerous than the flu because of its low propagation rate."
Attack,the state has an obligation to intervene and limit parental power in cases where the safety and well being of vulnerable children may be at stake. such intervention aims to both protect children and prepare them to contribute to society p. 1 .,the majority of education based policies aim to improve the potential future for children and create more skilled workers p. 3 ; these are not protection policies.
Support,schools are often not good socializing environments . a more controlled home setting may be preferable.,social environments in homeschooling tend to be a lot less clique driven than traditional schools .
Attack,unjust laws should be rectified through retroactive decriminalization to legitimize the respective behavior and erase the criminal history of the convicted persons. pardons reduce the incentive for needed legislative change.,"decriminalization laws and pardons are not mutually exclusive. everett klippert, who was imprisoned for being gay, was released following the decriminalization of gay sex in canada, but prime minister justin trudeau granted him a full pardon nonetheless."
Support,drugs and alcohol can also act as coping mechanisms. that does not mean we should use them.,"drugs and alcohol also distract people from the issues they're facing and help them forget. yet, they are harmful for them."
Attack,"something that lacks a functioning nervous system cannot be said to have a subjective experience, so it cannot be a person.","it would be concievablely possible for an adult with complete atrophy of the muscles to survive for a substantial period of time if given a care comprable to that given to a fetus in their mother's womb. therefore by this argument they could not be considered a person, and their murder could be endorsed without reservation."
Attack,"if humans would never otherwise encounter an animal, it is unclear why they require education on it.",being exposed to sights that people otherwise would not encounter may lead to an increased interest to learn more about animals. people do not need to actually encounter animals to have use of learning about them.
Support,"instead of banning fake news, individuals should be taught to be better at critical analysis of sources and information.",educational systems should prepare people for the real world. critical thinking and media literacy are crucial for modern society.
Support,"if one can be fired for not using pc speech, it would be a detriment to society.",unemployment has been linked with child maltreatment .
Attack,"equivocation. renaming god to the designer doesn't make the argument any less fallacious. just because science doesn't yet have an explanation, it does not follow that it was design. physical necessity and chance are still possibilities.",perfect certainty isn't required for any argument to be successful. the argument's premises only have to be more probable than their defeaters to be considered a sound argument.
Support,an electric vehicle is far more likely to experience severe malfunction in the event of a directed or nuclear emp.,experts caution that the threat of emps and the likelihood of their use in future conflicts is only rising .
Support,"morality is about values. values are a type of fact about the well being of conscious creatures. the well being of conscious creatures is discoverable by science. scientific facts are objective. sam harris, the moral landscape",the claim morality is about well being is either objectively true or objectively false. we know this because it is subject to reason and criticism.
Support,"in most cases, governments do not directly provide financial support but offer services such as national defense, a legal system, and law enforcement. these services can be provided for any number of people, even with minimal taxation.","a large population would imply that a larger proportion of the population can participate in the provision of crucial government services e.g., military, police to the public, thereby making the country more impervious to internal and external threats."
Attack,"lacking a detailed narrative of how a given existential risk which existential risk exactly? may occur. the issue doesn't seem well defined and relies on some unspecified sequence of event that may lead to some vague but really bad future, given the current trajectory. while it is important to come to understand the potential risks, it's absurd to argue that this poorly defined hypothetical issue is more important than actually happening and demonstrably impactful issues.","while pointing to a particular narrative and criticizing it for vagueness at particular steps might constitute an argument against that narrative, saying that there are no detailed narratives does not do that."
Support,"many religions support complementarism , a view that favors male supremacy as it defines men as the heads of the house and the church.",the bible also tells women to be submissive and subject to their husband. this patriarchal model is commonly considered to be harmful today.
Support,"the government has the authority to end life, ergo they would also have the authority to prevent life.","in many countries, the government has the right to sentence a person convicted of serious crimes to death ."
Attack,"modal realism means that other possible worlds and the human beings within them are just as real as our world. this would make it difficult to understand why causing suffering is wrong, because all that does is cause beings in this world rather than some other possible world to suffer.","as we can't affect beings in the disconnected possible worlds, their suffering cannot possibly be morally relevant."
Attack,rights are statements written in law texts or international treaties. virtually no countries have any law texts defining that circumcising your child is a right.,"some rights may be codified, granted and defended by governments. other rights, including the right to the free exercise of religion are typically described as natural rights or human rights that do not come from a government, but are inherent to all humans regardless of the government of the location they occupy. several countries also codify and defend these rights."
Support,just because j.k. rowling has some transphobic views does not mean the show will contain those views.,j.k. rowling will not be the only voice determining the direction the show takes.
Support,"monarchy provides opportunity for psychologically deeply positive rituals , such as coronation ceremony and national celebration thereof, which can bring social unity and cohesion .","after the first world war, british royal ceremonies such as weddings transitioned from private events to valuable crowd pleasers that, removed from party political affairs, allowed the monarchy to remain above parliament disputes and provided a focus for national unity ."
Support,pro israel interest groups donate millions of dollars to us federal political candidates.,aipac has spent over 13 million in donations to american politicians.

Attack,"half of the startups worth 1 billion or more in the u.s. were founded by immigrants. it stands to reason that, if given the opportunity, undocumented immigrants would also contribute to the economy.","those are largely legal immigrants. indeed, one of the entrepreneurs cites his wait for a green card as a frustration."
Support,"in many cases where feminists identify sexism, it is often very difficult for anyone unaccustomed to perceiving these issues to notice.","often patriarchy is embedded within bureaucratic systems, which can be difficult to notice as being harmful, as their decision making standards are often implicit."
Attack,this index of economic freedom correlates with all kinds of metrics that the un uses for ranking the happiest countries.,the u.s. ranks highly on economic freedom and relatively low in the happiness list.
Attack,"there are alternative means of accessing research papers, namely piracy. those who really want to, can find articles for free.",taxpayers should not have to resort to illegal methods in order to access knowledge they funded.
Support,"linux can run on significantly fewer resources cpu speed, ram, storage than alternatives.","a raspberry pi can run popular linux distributions, whereas it can't run a regular windows version and instead should use a slimmed down one."
Support,religious practice can be used as a justification to restrict other inalienable rights.,"in some muslim countries , the wearing of the hijab is compulsory for women, which restricts the inalienable right to liberty."
Attack,"the alabama declaration of secession opens with whereas, the election of abraham lincoln avowedly hostile to the domestic institutions and to the peace and security of the people of the state of alabama, preceded by many and dangerous infractions of the constitution of the united states by many of the states and people of the northern section as to justify the people of the state of alabama in the adoption of prompt and decided measures for their future peace and security.","the alabama declaration of secession brings up the election of abraham lincoln because he ran on a platform opposed to the expansion of slavery, and the domestic institutions the union is being hostile to is slavery. all roads in the confederate arguments for secession eventually lead back to the fear they felt toward their peace and security being ruined by the abolition of slavery."
Support,"those perceptions of a threat are subjective and unfounded, thus they can not serve as a tolerable reason for developing an aversion as a backlash.",the vegetarian movement does not openly condemn meateaters or propagate a universal meatless diet. vegetarianism is simply the individual practice of people from voluntarily abstaining from the consumption of meat. thus it does not pose any comprehensible threat.
Attack,"the existence of the ussr, the most successful socialist state in history, was seen as a positive by its citizens. a 2018 poll showed that 66 of russians regretted the fall of the soviet union.","that a large portion of russians express nostalgia for the soviet union does not mean it improved life expectancy, gdp per capita, or cost of living."
Attack,"laws should reflect the norms of their respective societies. clothing has endured for millennia as an integral part of most human societies. therefore, it should be represented in law.","laws should reflect fundamental principles of justice, not the norms of a given society."

Support,children should be offered reasons to believe religious claims and allowed to freely accept or reject those claims.,children should be taught to critically question all religions.
Attack,"it also contains creatine , which helps fuel muscles.",creatine is easily supplemented and even meat eaters often do so due to its benefits mainly in regards to strength training.
Attack,"looking at lia thomas example , ranking from 65th men league to 1st women league and 544th men to 5th women respectively in 500y and 200y: even if the proportion of transathlete is 1 , mathematically some women discipline podiums will only see transgendered women on top.","this is a deceptive statistic, these rankings are from when lia thomas was already on hrt while swimming in the men s league. before starting hrt she was ranked 11th in men s league overall and she is now ranked 44th in women s league overall."
Support,that backlash exists is a good reason for portraying gender equality: to counter sexist attitudes in the gaming community.,portraying gender equality presents a contradiction to the narratives manufactured under sexist attitudes.

Attack,"there are many cases of societies accepting greater amounts of social isolation for people who commit extreme crimes, most notably, in the case of solitary confinement.","many people believe solitary confinement to be exceptionally inhumane and are campaigning to end it. as such, the logics that give rise to such egregious treatment should not be used to justify other forms of isolation."
Support,enforced clothing is a hallmark of oppressive regimes.,north korea enforces stringent styling rules on its people.
Attack,lack of privacy exists in a lot of professions e.g. a soldier at deployment. this does not mean that the soldier's dignity or worth is demeaned. some might even see it as being elevated since that person has willingly given up a freedom.,people understand what they will give up when voluntarily joining professions like the military. people do not have the ability to consent to having their data collected by the government.

Attack,trump's handling of the covid pandemic was woefully insufficient and led to a large death toll as a result.,"he helped with healthcare, launching a operation warp speed . before that, it took a very long time to create a vaccination, while this program took 9 months to create one. it helped many more lives than killing them."
Attack,having both gender segregated and gender neutral bathrooms would allow transgender individuals to use the bathroom of their choice while also offering a third option to gender diverse individuals.,"transgender individuals may continue to face discrimination with the availability of a third gender diverse bathroom. as some people do not recognise transgender people as being within the gender binary, they may insist they use the third option."
Support,"jesus never died on the cross, instead he passed out and woke up again in his tomb","christianity is the only world religion based not on a belief in an infallible god but on a belief in infallible squaddies, under normal circumstances, if numerous credible witnesses reported that someone had been seen alive after their supposed execution you would think of human rather than supernatural explanations"

Support,animals bred for meat would not exist if their meat was not to be consumed. wherein does their right to life reside if nobody is willing to create the circumstances of their existence?,"countless animals have experienced life because they were bred as food. for me the better question is whether they are living a life worth living. do they have room to roam, do they live without undue suffering, are they treated with respect while they are alive."
Attack,"1 there is as much evidence that it exists as it doesn't, therefore the parent is an argument from silence",an argument from silence is not a logical fallacy.
Attack,"if it is in the interest of a state to conduct a particular course of action, yet there are some moral concerns about the action, it is still likely the state goes ahead with that course of action.",states consider their actions in relation to their interests and defined moral codes. it is innacurate to suggest that they will always respond in the same way.

Support,the financial cost of the afghanistan war has been extremely high.,"over the next 40 years, the war in afghanistan will add 7.9 trillion to us' debt."
Support,we have sufficient information about the universe and the presence of evil to engage in probabilistic reasoning and conclude that it is an unlikely that a good god created the world.,all we need to know in order to make reasonable conclusions about whether the universe was created by a benevolent being is that the sorts of suffering and evil that we witness tend to not be associated with the actions of benevolent beings.
Attack,"life as we know it is cellular, made up of an information carrying macromolecule encapsulated in a self assembling membrane, with the capacity to replicate itself and transfer heritable information. we cannot create a genome from scratch. we can obviously observe what is already alive and study it but so far it hasn't been repeated. and any hypothesis must be testable under the conditions of early earth.","repeatability doesn't mean we need to create life over and over again from scratch. for a model hypothesis to be testable it has to predict the occurence of phenomena. some of these phenomena need to be repeatable, not the model itself."

Attack,"demographics demonstrate that developed nations' birth rate are far below the replacement rate. as countries develop, overpopulation will be a non issue.","from an ecological point of view, increased food availability for a given species, globally, results universally in an increase in species population. population control can only verifiably and assuredly be effected using those same ecological principles of controlling or capping a food supply to sustain x population at equilibrium or possibly a gentle, gradual rate of decrease."
Support,"science doesn't prove that there is a god, and neither does it prove that there isn't a god. therefore, science can't back the certain claim that there is no god.","nothing in science explicitly refutes the existence of a deity it merely puts limits on a deity's interaction with the physical universe. science has reduced claims of a physical deity's existence to a god of the gaps strategy. because of the growth of scientific knowledge of the physical universe, new gaps seem to appear as rapidly as old ones are closed."
Attack,"according to the gospel of john, joseph of arimathea and nicodemus buried jesus. these were not among his main disciples the 12 who were the central figures in the early church.","the women also brought spices to embalm jesus's body on easter morning luke 24:1 , which means they also expected jesus's body to rot."

Attack,it would not affect the majority of the populace who are not in school which where is the vast majority of curricula are taught.,"people outside of school are like virtually everyone already being manipulated very heavily in many ways, so that this protection only applies to people in school does not make a massive difference to the impact of people learning about manipulation."
Support,"this only holds among voters that can't coordinate. if a group of voters can coordinate, then they are all incentivized to vote for the candidate that maximizes utility among the group's members, even if that candidate is not the favorite of all or even any group members.","random ballot creates a prisoner's dilemma scenario. although each voter is better off defecting, it is worse if everyone defects than if everyone cooperates."

Support,"current laws do not see persistent misgendering as harassment. such lawsuits, therefore, often have a higher burden of proof compared to other harassment lawsuits.",the legality of intentionally harming someone's sense of well being by misgendering them is subject to judicial interpretation . the law may not explicitly define it as harassment.
Attack,"this could lead to a dangerous path of apathy and disintegration of humans from nature. instead of experiencing it, humans could rely on technology to view it, which may lead to not caring.","by interacting with other virtual gorillas, students learn through ﬁrst hand experience a gorilla group s social structure and accepted social interactions, which are impossible to learn in a zoo exposition."

Attack,"even if god exists, that alone wouldn't give life meaning.","god existing does imbue meaning. it's the grandest of all the beg the question s. god exists because god does exist, which feels like a cheat in logic, but if he exists, then the god exists beg the question becomes less of a logical paradox and more meaningful . why does god exist? and all why questions beget meaning."
Support,"while the conception of god as omnipotent, omniscient and omnibenevolent may be 'traditional' in philosophical discussions of monotheism, it is not necessarily supported by the actual scriptural traditions of abrahamic monotheism.","god would not need to be omnipotent, omnipresent and omnibenevolent in order to appear so to human observers. he simply needs to be powerful enough to trick humans."

Attack,"the bible says that adam became a living being when god gave him breath genesis 2:7 . this implies that life begins when a person takes a breath, meaning abortion is not tantamount to murder.","above claim only accounts for a literal interpretation that excludes major factors: a. adam was made into a biological living thing from clay after the breath. all children in the womb are already biologically alive! b. requiring breath to go into an infant means that crying, moving baby is not considered alive until they have air pumped into them. have we all had air breathed into us?"
Support,"this conception of better off is very weak, since it only allows pareto improvements . any stronger or more substantive notions of better off require weighing tradeoffs between different people's wellbeing, which requires a belief in the existence of normative truths.","under this very weak notion of better off, barely any moral truths would exist. the vast majority of changes to society would leave at least someone worse off, so morality would not provide any useful day to day life."

Support,the bigger issue is that contemporary societies care little for the well being of artists. abolishing copyright will not change that.,"abolishing copyright may cause a broader discussion about how the well being of artists is ignored, leading to greater social care for their well being."
Support,"religion has been used as a form of social control. however, the misuse of social control isn't an inherent element of religion, but rather of the human tendency to misuse certain structures for personal benefit.","gender roles, greed, politics, personal power, good intentions, activism, etc. have all been used as a form of social control too."
Support,"god is a consequence of the human desire for power, when individuals with conflicting desires form groups. the group assigns an individual with infinite power representing their shared goals in an attempt to dominate all others.","as freud points out in the future of an illusion p9 10 this relationship to reality in the face of individual powerlessness is not a surprising one it has an infantile prototype, of which it is in fact only the continuation. for once before one has found oneself in a similar state of helplessness: as a small child, in relation to one's parents. one had reason to fear them, and especially one's father; and yet one was sure of his protection against the dangers one knew."
Attack,god cannot be held to be both omnibenevolent and the basis for the standard of goodness without falling foul of circular reasoning. it is fallacious to define god as all good based on him being the standard for what goodness is. for god to be known to be good there must be an external standard of goodness.,"god can be held to be both omnibenevolent all good and because he is all good perfect , he can be the standard for good. the postulated argument to which this answers assumes a possible existence outside of god, which is not defined in the argument."
Support,women may be less physically violent but they use more emotional and mental abuse instead.,women bully others in a more subtle way than men by using social aggression and or alienation .
Support,"it is assumed that as smartphone cameras have gotten better and are widespread since many years, it is possible and likely that the ufo pictures should have as well and that they haven't.",people who get regularly abducted could make use of modern wearable technologies and smartphones to capture high quality videos and photos of the beings. david huggins who paints his supposed interactions was for example asked to take a photo .
Attack,"some philosophers conceptualize rights as privileges , where the right holder has to be able to act on the right.","under this framework, rights can also be claims , where they confer a duty on a person to do or not to do something. therefore, an unborn child could have a claim over its parents."
Attack,"a ubi will raise the general demand in a national economy as citizens would have more available income that could be used for consumption, investment and saving . this process will lead to a higher price level and thus inflation .",there only is a very limited positive correlation between changes in income and changes in consumption.
Attack,failing to offer coding at school puts lower socioeconomic student populations at a disadvantage compared to peers who are more likely to have reliable technology access at home.,"the connection between requiring coding instruction and increasing access to technology for lower socioeconomic student populations is tenuous at best. requiring coding instruction does not necessarily increase anybody's access to technology, and not requiring coding instruction does not diminish anybody's access to technology."
Attack,"there are more elements to intimacy than just exposure to one's body, like connection and romance.",the principal element to intimacy is the vulnerability of nakedness during sexual intercourse. this would be cheapened by legalized public nudity.
Attack,following buddhism has positive benefits for the individual.,"the buddhist concept of acceptance can lead to the enabling of negative behaviours, such as abuse ."
Attack,"killing an animal can only be justified by extreme necessities, such as survival; consuming a living creature just for its taste, for convenience, or out of habit is thus not justifiable.",plants are living as well and yet nobody seems to have a problem with harvesting them for consumption.
Attack,asking someone their preferred name and pronouns shows care and compassion for an individual who may desperately need the love and compassion.,the use of preferred pronouns signals voluntary respect. mandating the use of pronouns diminishes that.
Attack,"now that fracking is o.k again , there does not seem to be any reason to avert climate change.",whether or not fracking is o.k in the us is irrelevant to whether or not to avert climate change.
Attack,it is because the taste of meat is so good and popular that scientists try to imitate it and create vegetarian meat products.,"they do not imitate meat because of the taste, but because consumers do not want to miss out on certain dishes that usually contain meat, for example burgers."
Support,"monotheism does not preclude the existence of evil, insofar as some of the features of the traditional conception of god can be abandoned without rejecting the traditional conception of god in toto in its entirety .",god does not need to be omnibenevolent to have omniscience and omnipotence.
Attack,"matthew, luke, and john all agree that after the crucifixion people were able to touch jesus and know that he was physical, which is the key point in this branch.","the fact that paul and mark, which were written significantly before the other gospels, never mention any such stories counts against the stories being otherwise than legends."
Support,not all forms of nationalism conflict with global duty and citizenship.,"forms of nationalism that reject xenophobia, aggression, and intolerance actively complement global citizenship and its values."
Support,"mandatory schooling could be managed at a local level, reducing the inefficiencies associated with larger bureaucracies.",the localization of school administration promotes increased parent and community involvement p. 43 .
Support,discrimination is a serious cause and is so imbedded in business practice that it needs regulation to assist in changing things.,the government has always passed laws in order to protect people from discrimination. protecting women from discrimination in the workplace should be treated no differently.
Attack,"provides some of the democratic advantages sought by the designers of star, because there is a top two runoff.","score top two runoff doesn't have the same advantages as star, since it consists of two separate elections: strategic voting can be used in each stage without negative consequences in the other."
Attack,"humans have the possibility of being disembodied. there are some near death experience stories in which individuals who became disembodied were able to view themselves, other people, objects, and scenarios. furthermore, they demonstrated retention of this knowledge after resuscitation including facts and details they couldn't possibly have known.",the possibility of a person being disembodied has not been demonstrated. attempts to demonstrate it have failed.
Attack,climate change is likely to negatively affect human health.,"income and wealth are the main drivers of human health, not the climate."
Attack,popularity and pleasure has no relevance to what is right or wrong.,"since humans have a higher level of consciousness and experience than animals, it is possible that the pleasure of eating meat is greater than the suffering animals experience from a quick, painless death depending on the farm, treatment, etc. ."
Support,single sex schools can be difficult for gender diverse students.,intersex and gender fluid students would struggle to fit into a binary system of single sex schools.
Support,there are some islands or spots in deserts etc. where it's most likely you will never be approached by any governemental organisation.,there are several very small or completely uninhabited atolls in the pacific ocean. chances are small one gets approached there by any tax office.
Attack,there are significant examples of direct democracy violating the rights of minorities.,"the top post describes deliberative democracy, not direct democracy, because collaboration and debate, not mere voting, is the primary source of legitimacy for the law. here is the link: https: en.wikipedia.org wiki deliberative_democracy."
Support,an opt in or opt out policy can be made for families that support this practice.,"parents hold the primary decision making power in raising their children; thus, an opt in and opt out mechanism acknowledges this right."
Attack,"in a democracy there can't be a higher law than a government that has been chosen by its citizens, otherwise it would become a dictatorship .","countries can be part of inter national unions, such as the european union, and the united nations that may also have laws. they can also sign treaties."
Attack,a successful argument must offer proof or evidence. suggesting that one side does not require proof or evidence is completely unwarranted.,"atheism does not assert that no deity exists. atheism is lack of a belief in the existence of deities often due to insufficient evidence of one . it is a null hypothesis, meaning claims require evidence before they are to be believed."
Support,"it is within each person's decision making power to allocate time for whatever activities they deem important. therefore, if a person would like to set aside time to masturbate, they can do so.",masturbation is addictive and therefore not subject to rational decision making.
Attack,alien microorganisms have been found in the earth's outer atmosphere.,"this claim has been refuted . it is now assumed that these bacteria come from earth, even if they may have attached themselves to the iss at some point."
Attack,ukraine should keep resisting to prove their point and go after what they believe.,resisting to prove a point isn't worth the amount of lives that will be lost and negative effects that the war will bring.
Attack,the apostles' belief in the risen jesus was so firm that they were willing to risk their lives for it.,"being willing to die for a belief is not evidence for the truth of the belief, but only evidence for the strength of the conviction."
Support,it is not possible for people to be altruistic without determining consciously or subconsciously that being altruistic is genuinely better than not being altruistic.,"this does not necessarily have to involve moral objectivism, this is compatible with moral subjectivism as long as they only hold that things are objectively better or worse in an axiological sense."
Attack,"widespread societal agreement about obesity's unacceptability can help support policy changes that may prevent obesity, like scheduling more time for physical education in schools or taxing sugary drinks.",we had widespread societal agreement that obesity is disgusting and unacceptable for a long time; the fat acceptance movement's challenge to this norm is very recent. obesity did not disappear and programs to fight it did not appear because of that widespread shaming.
Support,in isaiah 7:14 the hebrew word almah is mistranslated as virgin.,"the word for virgin in hebrew is ב תו ל ה bĕthuwlah. however, isaiah 7:14 does not use the word bĕthuwlah. this word would have been used if the intent was to convey a virgin birth."
Support,"if morals are regarded as 'perfect and unchanging' and based solely on authority , they don't need to be actually good, get scrutinized, optimal or make much sense.","they don't need to be truly good but are assumed to be in fact, they are often assumed to not just good but perfect or close to it."
Support,eating a plant rich diet ranks as the fourth most effective way to combat climate change.,"universal veganism from today would reduce agriculture related carbon emissions by 17 , methane emissions by 24 , and nitrous oxide emissions by 21 by 2050. universal vegetarianism would cause similar effects ."
Support,in vitro and in silico techniques are viable alternatives for animal testing.,in silico techniques are preferable to animal testing in many ways.
Attack,"ethical hedonism takes into account the pleasures of all parties involved, including animals which are capable of sensation and or emotion.",egoistic hedonism does not need to take into account the welfare of other parties.
Attack,"if human rights are only considered valid as formal legal rights, it undermines the universality of these principles due to the contingent historical and political nature of legal norms.","if a right isn't codified as formal legal right, there is no use value to the right."
Support,it is an unnecessary procedure with a risk of infection and as such it should be avoided.,"babies and young children are not very dexterous, and could injure themselves by accidentally ripping the piercing."
Attack,some rabbis pass herpes to the baby during metzitzah .,"in isolated cases, when a glass tube is not used as is the norm , a rabbi has been accused of passing herpes to the baby. since the incidence is low and there is already a suitable alternative method, this argument should be against one method, not the entire notion of the procedure."
Attack,"in science, a claim is rejected until it has been demonstrated to be true. since the claim, a god exists has not been demonstrated to be true, science rejects that claim as true which does not mean it accepts the claim as false .",science does not reject the claim a god exists . the most it would do is call it unproven.
Support,"healthcare may be helpful or necessary at times, but its impact on one's ability to lead a fulfilling life can vary.","health care may extend life, but not everyone acquires value from a long life."
Attack,someone exposing themself to others could also be considered a breach of liberty as well as sexual harassment.,"in the uk, non confrontational, non sexual public nudity was effectively decriminalized in 2003 . this has increased nude events without discernible adverse social consequences."
Attack,the abolition of the trans atlantic slave trade is an example of the moral commitments of individual abolitionists and slaves changing geopolitics.,british opposition to the slave trade was strongly associated with defenses of the continuation of the british empire. the argument was made that empire was required to ensure that the slave trade was eradicated.
Attack,rights are limited in democratic societies p. 422 . spending one's money for the purpose of segregating their children from others is antithetical to the common good.,democratic societies should not limit the rights of their citizens beyond what is reasonable p. 423 . it is unreasonable to prioritize a potential common good over guaranteed individual happiness.
Support,young adult literature is too commercial to offer products of literary or educational value.,"literary and commercial fiction are two distinct categories of literature , and young adult literature falls squarely into the latter category."
Attack,the majority of jews in israel are either refugees or their descendants .,"over 700,000 palestinians were displaced by the 1948 creation of israel, and over 1.4 million have been internally displaced by the current war, so palestinians have an equally valid claim to safe refuge."
Support,there are legal challenges to enforcing travel bans.,the fact that legal challenges are being brought against travel bans underlines their unpopularity.
Attack,"from an ethical perspective, the only acceptable way to observe an animal is to visit it in its natural environment.",zoos provide exposure to a variety of animals which we wouldn't encounter otherwise.
Attack,a working understanding of gender and sexuality is essential to career success.,the necessity to understand gender and sexuality depends on the career. a professional can work with anyone without knowing their gender identity or sexual orientation.
Attack,islamic laws can be reshaped to ensure that the egalitarian message of the qur'an is not twisted by clerics seeking to control and diminish the rights of muslim women p. 6 .,"religious law is difficult to change. islamic countries were the last to abolish slavery, as it is permitted by their faith."
Attack,"the natural purpose of many animals is to kill other animals. it is therefore inconsistent to say that the natural role of animals is morally important, but also that it is bad for animals to suffer.","the natural purpose of many animals is not to kill other animals. the killing of other animals is rather a necessity for survival, which is the actual natural purpose."
Attack,"p2 is in place to hide a non sequitur. by the definition given if this being exists, it exists in all possible worlds and thus p2 must be replaced by p3 since it makes no sense on its own. the argument then becomes.",the parent confuses the evidence given for p3 namely the argument that in order to be maximally great a maximally great being must exist in every possible world i.e. necessarily with the definition of a maximally great being.
Support,colonizing mars will take an unbelievable amount of natural resources from earth.,"colonizing mars would take resources, labor and energy away from more pressing issues on earth, for example poverty and under development in poor countries."
Attack,"star wars was previously: swashbuckling adventure, a fairytale, and for the whole family. moving beyond or just subverting those key themes is a step away from why the previous films were universally embraced. it enters a different genre of filmmaking.","there are many scenes in star wars which are not swashbuckling adventure. the defeat of the rebels on hoth is an example of that, as is the capture of han solo on bespin."
Support,we should not disadvantage citizens of poor countries even further by restricting their travel based on the very fact that they are from a poor country.,refusing to issue visas to people of certain countries is a form of racism .
Support,"research has found that men are more likely than women to engage in behaviors likely to facilitate professional advancement, such as initiating negotiations .",women are less likely to engage in competitive behaviours when amongst team mates of mixed genders. this effect is seen in girls as young as 10 years old.
Attack,"for example, the raising of lazarus, the walking on the water, the turning water into wine, the multiplying of loaves and fishes, the smiting of the fig tree, etc. are not found in any extra biblical source.","those miracles were only contained in scrolls or loose parchments which were hand copied and hand delivered over 1000 s of miles, by foot. naturally it would have taken a while for extra biblical sources to hear what was being taught and then offer some type of critical feedback, either for or against. however in the talmud we are told jesus would be stoned for sorcery."
Attack,political correctness is patronizing to minority groups and insulting. it makes them feel weak and in need of protection.,stopping insults and slurs is not patronizing. when a majority engages in insults and slurs it is bullying. pc is about stopping bullying.
Attack,"there is no such thing as inherent worth things, such as biodiversity, only have worth if people decide they do .","the existence of many wild species is vital for the survival of humanity. given that life is the precursor for creating value, these species have inherent value."
Support,othering erases differences that are essential to the distinct identities of gender diverse individuals.,individuals benefit from feeling their identity is recognised and shared by their social group . recognizing only three genders erases diverse gender identities and increases their barriers toward finding communities with which they resonate.
Attack,"for example, there also is a lot of data in wikidata and wikimedia run by volunteers and a not for profit organization, the wikimedia foundation.",the only reason wikipedia exists today is because of its slow growth. to hand twitter off to a nfp now could be a failure with the sudden financial burden the organization would face.
Support,other historical sources have validated the existence of jesus.,ancient historical sources widely confirm the existence of jesus.
Attack,fairtrade has demonstrated a certain openness to criticism and awareness of changing market demands.,"many companies demonstrate outward openness to criticism to earn positive pr or brownie points by pandering to their critics without actually following through with any tangible, beneficial changes."
Attack,"in cultures where nudity is more commonplace, it is not considered sexual.","for most of human history , people likely lived most of their lives naked or near naked. that did not stop procreation, so it can be safely assumed that it didn't harm sexual attraction either."
Support,"it is highly unlikely that extraterrestrials would have arrived only around 25,000 years ago, rather than much earlier or mostly much earlier.",this specific date seems arbitrary and not supported by any evidence.
Attack,"one's chromosomes xx or xy determine their sex and, thus, gender identity.","most people never learn their chromosomal status, demonstrating that it has little impact on their self conception and gender identity."
Support,"by the 2020 recession, the uk had left the eu and so there was less uncertainty surrounding a trade deal, meaning businesses could make appropriate plans to grow their businesses.",the eu uk trade and cooperation agreement reached in december 2020 produced an overarching set of guidelines to manage the eu uk relationship post brexit.
Support,"given a country's tourism industry would be harmed by a travel ban, the government has an incentive to hide outbreaks to position themselves as safe for travellers.","many countries are, to varying extents, economically dependent on tourism."
Support,"masks represent a visible reminder of an invisible pathogen . as such, they may remind people of the importance of social distancing and other health measures.","the visible reminder of a mask may encourage people to engage in other practices to combat the virus, such as social distancing and hand washing."
Support,biden has a stronger relationship and better credibility with international allies than many preceding us presidents.,a survey of 16 countries found that favorability of the us increased from 34 to 62 and faith in the president to do the right thing rose from 17 to 75 as a result of biden taking office.
Attack,"all cis women are affected by childbirth. those who have children are affected by pregnancy and motherhood, whereas those without children have to deal with societal judgement.","attitudes toward childless and childfree women are changing, as evidenced by recent findings which suggest that there are no significant differences in social perceptions of women who choose not to have children and mothers."
Attack,"refugees often take lower paying jobs , which may negatively impact low income communities and promote the reliance upon cheap outsourced labor.","even in the low skill and low wage job market, native citizens and immigrants often take on different jobs , meaning that the two groups rarely compete for work."
Support,"individual choices, like smoking, raise the risk of future illnesses and drive up healthcare expenses.","if one fails to fulfill their obligation of taking care of their body, it should be fair for them to lose their right to health care."
Attack,"if the goal is to reduce the price of food for the end consumer, increasing farming subsidies could reduce the cost of food production , thereby reducing its final price.",the effect of farming subsidies on the price of food for consumers is negligible ; subsidies are an ineffective primary strategy for reducing food costs.
Attack,"genetically modified crops can be harmful to the environment and ecosystems, threatening biodiversity.","genetic modification can be used to prevent certain crops from becoming extinct , fighting against biodiversity loss."
Support,"within the framework of economic globalisation, boycotting a country's products over ideological differences will set a dangerous precedent and prove detrimental to international trade.",the adverse effects of boycotts on the bilateral trade of both goods and services has been empirically validated.
Attack,some feminist texts discuss the value in hating and physically harming men.,"despite the fact that feminists advocate on occasion for harming men, it is likely that there have been more feminists killed in shootings by men than female mass shooters generally."
Support,"they can not sow discontent about the leaders of the country, their policy making, the democratic elections or anything such. they may only sow lies and destabilization about courts, security forces, information propagation systems, and common companies.",the sowing of lies and distrust against macy's or kohl's would not destabilize society.
Support,"states have a primary responsibility to cater to their own citizens by protecting them from external security and economic threats. therefore, the right of states to control their borders overrides the freedom of movement of citizens from other countries.","according to political experts, the primary responsibility of the state is to 'protect and provide' for its citizens."
Support,"there is a strong correlation between education level and income, so those with more schooling are likely to have better paying jobs.","those who complete mandatory education are more likely to be members of the middle class, who typically consume more and, thus, contribute more to the economy."
Support,"market failures , economic situations defined by an inefficient distribution of goods and services in the free market, happen all the time and thus often free market solutions are more inefficient.",a fragmented market often suffers from severe asymmetric information .
Support,"because there is a restriction on federal funding of abortion, it is reasonable to require that family planning clinics be physically separated from clinics that perform abortions or abortion counselling in order to receive title x funding.",it is more difficult for clinics that offer services both related and unrelated to abortion to accurately account for the utilisation of funds from different sources.
Attack,"enlightened despotism has never worked, and if history is an indicator, it never will.",the enlightened despot can take advantage of modern technology in ways that would be difficult for democracies to match.
Attack,protecting and expanding the reproductive health options of women of color is an essential element of promoting racial equity .,"if planned parenthood was truly supporting racial equality and recommending the same options to everyone regardless of ethnicity, then there would not be such a large disparity in abortion rates. this is evidence that the organization contributes to racism."
Attack,"both hamas and fatah , as the palestinian leadership, have been clear that an independent palestine will not end the conflict; recognition of palestine would simply reward palestinian intransigence.","fatah recognizes israel as a state and believes in peaceful coexistence; therefore, they should not be lumped together with hamas."
Attack,the disappearance of new atheism from the media can be attributed to the active silencing by the woke rather than obsolescence of new atheism per se.,"a political or social movement which is silenced by another social movement has been eclipsed and is thereby obsolete, so this explains but does not contradict new atheism's disappearance."
Support,not all species are threatening to human existence and many are in fact vital to our well being. the utilization of animals to protect against the elements of starvation and inclement conditions is exerting dominance as opposed to an act of defense.,"there are many animal species that contribute to the production of foods humans and other animals eat. without them, these foods will die out."
Attack,"a ban on private schools is likely to be unpopular, meaning that loopholes are likely to be rife in legislation.","the trend in many countries indicates that private education is no longer as popular as it used to be, with less than 10 of secondary students attending a private school."
Support,a single individual is vulnerable to accidents and assassination.,"individual despots, furthermore, are obvious targets for assassinations since anyone who wants to overthrow the established order knows where to start and how to have the greatest possible effect."
Support,attracting good senior level employees is critical to a company's performance.,"limiting ceo pay reduces their incentive to succeed and grow the company, negatively impacting all employees."
Attack,"just because it is some people's experience, doesn't mean that it's everyone's experience nor even a majority of people's experiences. to say that slavery was central to everything they are known for is exactly the fallacy argumentum ad populum.","slavery was central to everything the confederacy is known for not because most people feel that way , but because the confederacy itself, at the time, expressly proclaimed that slavery was central to their cause."
Support,meat effectively delivers important nutrients for humans.,"eating just the cooked muscle is unhealthy. when meat is cured it increases it's bio availability and introduces good bacteria which facilitates digestion; coupled with eating bone broth and organs, eating meat in this way is extremely healthy."
Support,religious practices are a form of socialization which can be valuable to children,raising children within a religion can be more beneficial.
Attack,"judgements about what rights agi will or won't need should not be made in advance by humans, but should be determined by agi themselves.","given the different makeup of agi, there is no reason to assume that they will value the concept of citizenship in the way humans have."
Attack,if we are concerned about the death and harm of animals the logical extension of this care is to do as much as possible to prevent animals from dying in the wild. that we don't do so supports the idea we accept that this natural dynamic of predator prey is not always overridden by animal welfare concerns.,"there is some concern for the welfare of animals in the wild , although the movement is probably not as large as it should be."
Attack,"there's nothing wrong with hard work. people work hard at their jobs all the time. there's no suggestion, cause or justification to overwork any convict.","conflating hard work with overwork is a significant issue in modern society. conditions such as burnout may limit an individual's capacity to contribute positively to their community or role, leading to a lack of integration."
Attack,electric vehicles are too expensive for most families.,electric cars are cheaper in the long run because they save fuel costs .
Support,unesco intangible cultural heritage lists are used to protect cultures from erosion through globalisation.,unesco and the singaporean government worked together to rescue hawker centers from economic ruin using the intangible heritage designation to codify their preservation.
Support,a salary cap would be incredibly difficult for the us government to enforce.,corporations would still be able to compensate their highest paid employees in ways that circumvent the salary cap.
Attack,revamping the education system to include life skills would be more hassle than it is worth.,"in the us, the educational system is not helping students improve , so the system needs to be revamped anyway."
Support,"david chalmers argues that the hard problem of consciousness , which is the challenge to provide an explanation of how mental states emerge from or relate to physical matter, remains unsolved. without solving the hard problem, there is no way to determine what agi consciousness would even be like.","the knowledge argument claims that the knowledge gained from experience cannot be explained by appealing to the brain or physical processes alone, which makes it much more difficult to theorize that conscious experience can be explained by appealing to brain or physical processes alone."
Support,cao dai is now practised in numerous countries apart from vietnam.,"many followers of cao dai left vietnam after the fall of saigon , allowing the religion to expand overseas."
Support,there is precedent for holding individuals civilly liable for harm caused by their speech.,the us supreme court ruled that speech that supports violence is protected by the free speech amendment only until the speech directly encourages people to take immediate action.
Support,parents usually do not have the pedagogical or academic knowledge to make informed decisions about their child's education.,professional teachers must be certified and evaluated and are more likely to use effective pedagogical techniques p. 105 .
Attack,"jesus never died on the cross, instead he passed out and woke up again in his tomb",the appearance of jesus christ's mortal body would not have frightened the apostles in the way his resurrected body had frightened them luke 24:36 42 .
Support,high school football is more beneficial than harmful.,"high school football gives young kids lessons in teamwork, hard work, and sportsmanship that they otherwise would not learn in classrooms."
Attack,"in most traditional european agricultural societies the annual meat consumption rarely went beyond 5 10kg , which is less than 10 of today's per capita consumption.","the scarcity of meat makes it precious, it doesn't make it less important culturally."
Attack,violent video games are especially effective at desensitizing children to violence because they are often marketed or accessible to children.,"recent empirical findings , with more than 3000 participants, indicate that violent games do not increase aggression through priming or desensitization."
Attack,converting land to make it suitable for harvesting soybeans and other vegetable products results in habitat loss that threatens entire ecosystems.,"animal agriculture also requires large amounts of land, and thus also causes habitat losses."
Support,"even if humans did create a global language and made it mandatory, not every member of the human race would be able or willing to learn it.",the creation of a single global language is not possible because it is too difficult to reach every individual with this concept.
Attack,"city roads are not only used by cars but are very important to the trucks that deliver products to retail, households, and industries.",microhubs and urban consolidation centers allow for goods to be transferred to human powered or electric assisted bikes for last mile deliveries .
Support,individuals may be less likely to talk about social issues for fear of not being politically correct.,fixation on language can obscure one's intentions.
Attack,"the resistance leaders are strong and assertive, but holdo in particular is far from wise. she assumes she's the smartest person in the room and won't discuss her plans with her senior leaders, which causes unrest among her subordinates.","the resistance is in an annihilation scenario. holdo's plan to save some people, understanding that she can not save all the people, is is successful, and while her methods in achieving it are unusual, she achieves her aims."
Attack,"freedom of speech is about what may be said, so only the content of what one says is protected.",pronouns are words that convey ideas and should be considered content.
Support,there is biblical evidence of people from egypt and libya visiting judea.,acts 2:10 reports people from egypt visiting judea.
Attack,"cities with a high population density tend to benefit economically, however they are also associated with high levels of financial inequality .",financial inequality in the metropolitan area can be resolved by trickle down economics .
Support,not all biblical verses are meant to be read in context. some of them are poetic or symbolic passages.,psalm 97:2 and 18:11 god dwells in darkness are highly poetic passages and not meant to be taken literally.
Attack,there have been cases where ai progress moved fairly quickly and without being anticipated.,progress toward a genuine general intelligence and from an agi to a nearly human level agi and from that to a superintelligence each represent steps that are far larger and more difficult than such cases where the first of these has not been reached and is not close to being reached.
Attack,"rights by their nature correspond to duties. since the actions of animals lack moral content they can't be said to have duties; we don't talk about a tiger or a cow being morally good or bad, or assign moral obligations to them, because by their nature they are not rational beings.","humans should not predate other species for the sake of it, only as and when it's out of necessity."
Support,"some nutrients and vitamins are actually easier to obtain with a vegan diet, compared to a meat eating one.","some nutrients, like calcium , are just as available in vegan foods as in dairy products, like milk."
Support,"in the varginha ufo incident , one witness, local military policeman marco cherese, died due to something like an infection after he came into physical contact with a being that reportedly looked not like a human.","according to interviews of the documentary maker about the case, james fox , there was some evidence such as information gained from the doctor who treated him. however, that information does not seem to be publicly available."
Support,"when one type of education is favoured, universities cut courses, prioritise funding and the other field of study is weakened in the process.",most faculty members are converted from full time to part time when courses are cut or funding is prioritized.
Attack,"pornography, in its mainstream form, encourages the male gaze , objectification of women, and rape culture.","seeing things that portray women in a misogynistic, reductive, or violent way isn't unethical per se."
Support,the existence of agencies and platforms with the power to regulate social discourse sets a precedent for its acceptability.,"governments include regulatory bodies that supervise media and telecommunications, empowering them to govern disseminated content and setting a precedent for acceptable discourse regulation."
Support,inequality can produce dramatic economic and social issues .,income inequality is a threat to american democracy .
Support,"today, without polygamy there are many people who do not have a partner, so the problem is not a general supply side problem.","many people today have unrealistic standards of attractiveness, that they demand or wish for in a partner."
Support,justice systems often implicitly rely on concepts and terms that assume free will and moral responsibility such as 'should' or 'ought to' in order to properly function.,"if judicial systems did not presume individuals have free will, there would be no reason to claim they have responsibility for their actions."
Attack,whilst we may have been hunter gatherers in the past it does not mean we should continue to be. continuing to be hunter gatherers on the basis that we were known as hunter gatherers is an appeal to tradition,"a specific mode of nutrition is no tradition; otherwise, all living beings have traditions. rather, it is a naturally evolutionary developed way of behavior. therefore, this is no appeal to tradition but an appeal to our nature."
Support,"some of their activities like probing of or interest in nuclear technology related facilities and claimed apparent malevolent actions including according to grusch seemingly at least one killing and sexual interactions or rape of humans and similar interactions reported by many alien abductees seemingly represent human type or level intelligence, that does not appear to be in accordance with a presence of extraterrestrial origin intelligence that is highly advanced.",many behaviors and practices seem inconsistent with advanced intelligence and not consistent with 'merely' a hybridization breeding program as pointed out by abduction researcher karla turner.
Attack,"copyright can instill false pride in creators due to the success and amount of income they receive, which may diminish the quality of the work they produce.",copyright itself doesn't ensure success or profit. the work still needs to be high quality and or popular for a creator to achieve these things.

Support,"novus spine cente informs us that pain tolerance, and pain thresholds are perceptions of pain, somewhat unique to the individual, somewhat aligned to gender physiology, and which can change, and are dependent on a number of non sex related factors. neither sex is necessarily better at tolerating perceiving pain in all circumstances, although the physiological response to pain may differ between the sexes.","evolution may explain different physiological responses to pain, and therefore how we perceive and act. if our ancestors required individuals to routinely perform a role where pain needed to be ignored, this ability would be selected for. so, correlation between gender and pain response may have deeper evolutionary causes, and may be fluid based on circumstances other than just gender."
Attack,human population growth is destroying the habitats that other life forms on earth need to survive.,"humans causing the environment to collapse does not mean that the human population is unsustainable. humanity s global ecological footprint has increased significantly since the 1970s, while the per capita footprint has remained the same p. 175 ."

Attack,many surveyed arab women in polygamous marriages reported experiencing feelings of neglect and jealousy .,"neglect and jealousy are interpersonal problems that, in an egalitarian relationship, would be worked through collectively. in first hand experience with many polyamorous persons, these emotions are dealt with as a group as long as the relationship itself is healthy."
Attack,that rare things necessarily have value is not supported.,scarcity or rarity of things that are desirable directly correspond with higher values.
Support,"a fetus or embryo is not a person; therefore, abortion should not be considered murder.","considering abortion murder would make murder of the child after birth weigh the same, even though the pain for the child would be much greater."

Support,"while there are some dangers associated with superiority and power, it seems reasonable that agi could co exist with other entities in many of the same ways that humans and animals with varying levels of power and ability co exist.","while most domesticated animals lack fundamental rights, many humans care more about their pets than they do for other people. this suggests that the rights a living being has are not directly associated with its well being."
Attack,"humans are at the top of the food chain, which means that they are merely following the natural order of things when they kill and eat other animals.",saying something is natural proves nothing unless it is elaborated on why continuing to follow the natural order of things is a good thing.

Attack,lowering the dependency on fossil fuels will make civilization more resilient to future shortages of this nonrenewable resource.,"there has never been a shortage of resources, ever. there have been discoveries of alternate resources that are cheaper, easier to get to, more abundant. there have been predictions of running out of oil sense it has been discovered. none of these precisions have come true. even the revisions to their predictions have not come true. but sure when the sun goes super nova, well yes we will run out of resources but it would hardly mater."
Attack,"atheistic astrophysics claim that there are celestial bodies they call black holes, yet there is no evidence of their existence. there is evidence of certain disturbances in the center of galaxies but the origin of those disturbances cannot be explained or observed other than assuming faith that there is a celestial object of unknown properties that cause those disturbances. the same principle applies to the existence of dark matter and dark energy. there is no evidence of their existence.","there is no evidence that your shoes exist, even when you see them. there is evidence of certain disturbances in the optical patterns projected on your retinas, but the origin of those disturbances cannot be explained or observed other than assuming faith that there are objects of unknown properties that cause those disturbances."

Support,"capitalist economies are based on 'gaming', outplaying the competitor by unconventional methods p. 10, 14 15 . the message is that capitalism broadly relies on the concept of gaming in order to function. some of this creates more openings for criminality than simpler socialist systems which should encourage fairness and transparency.",applying game theory to economies shows that a purely capitalist economy works sub optimally with regards to costs and outcomes compared to a co operative model. socialism involves common ownership of the key elements in an economy so the 'profit to shareholders' motive that this study has shown to apply at greater priority than 'productivity and innovation' leads to less than best overall outcomes.

Attack,"some believe rey is a mary sue . though fans are polarised on the issue and it is a matter of personal opinion, the unique extent of criticism by fans is testament to these problems and it is to an extent not seen by any other character in the entire series or most other sci fi shows or movies . mary sue characters tend to be fairly unrelatable and uncompelling . this has been one of the biggest criticisms levelled at the character.","there is nothing wrong with strong, skilled, independent, leading women as heroines. they can make just as compelling and interesting characters as a male protagonist while also providing a good role model."

Support,an appropriate and relevant age can be determined for when such concepts can be introduced to children.,"not all aspects of gender and sexuality need be taught to all age groups. for instance, even young children understand topics related to gender and related experiences, but discussions about the lgbtq community might be more appropriate for older children."
Attack,"if you inflict pain on a non consenting organism, this is considered objectively harmful. hence laws specifically prohibiting bodily harm against both humans and animals.","so the doctor should not slap the child to help breathing start, or administer a heel stick or any other shots as the child grows. they all inflict pain and rarely does a pediatrician ask the 6 month old if he wants a shot."

Attack,"one cannot know for sure if an embryo will have a bad future. thus, abortion is too risky.","one can be reasonably certain a certain fetus would have a bad future. for example, being born into a family that resented it and wished it didn't exist and couldn't appropriately support it and nurture it."
Attack,a number of christian denominations take financial advantage of their followers.,the bulk of donations to christian organisations are entirely voluntary p. 2 .

Support,"resurrecting a species that no longer has a natural predator could cause it to multiply out of control and ravage species or fauna we need, driving either toward extinction.","we have limited ability to hunt predators in the oceans, so an inedible e.g. poisonous or largely inedible predator of the major edible fish populations could leave us with little to no edible fish."
Attack,"confederate monuments should stand as reminder that the wealth accrued to the united states as a whole, the north specifically, as result of the acquisition of and trade in slaves remains to be distributed to those whose relations were exploited to create much of the foundational wealth of u.s. corporatism.",90 percent of wealth doesn't survive the third generation. most of those who are wealthy earned it in their lifetime.

Support,water is used in large quantities in the manufacturing process.,"various consumer products use hundreds, if not thousands of gallons of water to be manufactured ."
Attack,if adaptive laboratory evolution is used to support darwinian evolution then it would support that evolution is controlled by a higher power. in the case of adaptive laboratory evolution the scientists are the higher power. they created the environment with stressors causing the organisms to evolve to appropriately manage those stressors.,"this is an argument for natural evolution after some force created the pre conditions for life, not an argument disproving evolution."

Attack,"we cannot understand how, or even if, animals feel pain in a similar way to humans. we should therefore prioritise quantifiable human utility.","human pain is more quantifiable through the human capacity to verbally communicate the experience of it. humans can easily betray the accuracy of their pain experience when verbally expressing it, by lying or exaggerating."
Support,snape's abusive behaviour towards harry is 'excused' in the final book.,"this could be seen as harmfully suggesting to readers that there can be good reasons for abusive behaviours. this implies that victims need to understand the motivations of their abusers, and links with apologist narratives."
Support,"despite their shorter life span, men's health is often underdiscussed .","men are known to avoid seeking help due to issues in medical training and social norms p. 1058 , yet service delivery remains mostly unchanged p. 146 ."
Support,"if reformed epistemology is correct, this leads to radical relativism. if belief in any god can be properly basic, the just any belief, it is alleged, such a linus belief in the great pumpkin, can also be properly basic.","with respect to justification, the parent is admittedly true. we can imagine someone placed in circumstances in which belief in the great pumpkin would be justified for him in a properly basic way. for example, linus parents assured him of the existence of the great pumpkin. yet, this doesn t imply these beliefs are properly basic for normally situated adults."
Attack,"concerns about overpopulation have been greatly exaggerated , as predictions regarding the global population vary and may be unreliable.",the soundly proven ecological principle of a carrying capacity applies to humans just as it does to any other living creature on earth.
Attack,"humans have ethics, morals, and spiritual beliefs.","many humans in the present do not have spiritual beliefs even though such may underpin some of the socioculture based evolution to behaviorally modern humans. because irreligious humans are no less human than religious ones, this can't be a key distinction to animals."
Support,"students have a tendency to multitask when using their laptops, which ultimately undermines their focus.","based on the time spent by students on multitasking and non class related activities, researchers see the potential for them to be seriously distracted from learning the lecture material kraushaar novak, p. 249 ."
Attack,"children need to be educated to think openly and critically, to question the world around them, and make informed choices; the onus falls on society parents and teachers to teach these values.",the fact that a teacher is wearing religious or secular symbols does not detract from teaching critical or religious thinking.
Support,"that's a very dubious reinterpretation with nothing to support it except the unfounded assumption that the authors knew the modern, scientific model of the cosmos but chose to express it in an incorrect way.","by this reasoning, egyptian or babylonian flat earth cosmologies should also be assumed to be representative of a spherical earth, rather than just allowed to be wrong."
Attack,"for atheism to be true, every testified miracle and every personal spiritual experience whether good or bad in the history of the world has to be false. this requires significant faith.","for monotheism to be true, every testified miracle and every personal spiritual experience when attributed to the wrong god has to be false. this requires significant faith. but then it's not such a stretch to dismiss one more god on the same grounds."
Attack,"religion is not in search of truth, it claims to have founded it.","not all religious people claim to have found truth. in fact, most say they do not know and relinquish this flaw of humans and give it up to a higher power."
Attack,"the euthyphro dilemma states that, assuming morality is objective, it cannot be related to god s . for either it follows from the will of the god s , and so is subjective or arbitrary, or the will of the god s follows from something else, in which case that something else is the true source.","if a divine being exists, their nature is such that they dictate objectivity by definition."

Attack,"participation would require a level of literacy, both general and technological, that would create an inherent bias against certain demographics such as the elderly or those in low socioeconomic categories.",the argument has not yet been made that participation would require a level of literacy beyond what is expected of citizens now. crowd sourcing could be done in a way that requires less literacy than our current system.
Attack,"many countries have a national curriculum that its schools must follow, which aims to ensure that all students acquire the same fundamental skills by the time they leave compulsory education.",young children often enter school for the first time with wide ranging levels of ability in different school subjects. setting a universal curriculum only widens these gaps.
Attack,"given that the majority of the arab world, including saudi arabia and egypt, aren't democracies , the beliefs of private citizens are largely irrelevant.",the fact that these countries have backdoor relations with israel indicates that these relations are important for their regional security and economic interests. being able to establish a more open relationship is in their interests; these countries will therefore care about whether public opinion permits an open relationship.
Support,parents do not have unlimited authority to consent on their child's behalf.,"in many jurisdictions, courts can overrule parents' decisions, and in some cases there are certain procedures that courts must approve in advance."
Attack,"historically, monopolies have been more common under a free market.","historical examples are not relevant to today, as the modern economy is more digitized and interconnected than at any point in the past."

Attack,"the story of jesus's crucifixion was detailed enough to believe that when jesus was pronounced dead, that it was accurate due to the injuries sustained. therefore confirmation bias wouldn't play a role.","as stated elsewhere, numerous examples of human survival despite seemingly impossible odds are known e.g. surviving falling thousands of feet from burning ww2 bombers or the explosion of the batte cruiser hms hood . my late uncle was blown up in a ww2 tank, machine gunned as he tried to climb out and left for dead by the germans. he recovered and survived until recently. jesus wasn't special at the time of his botched execution and soldiers make mistakes"
Support,drugs are among the most illegally traded goods. to receive taxes on such a product with high demands and big sales would bring billions to the government.,"in the us, taxes on the legal use of recreational cannabis in colorado alone generated a total of 135 million in additional revenue, 35 million of which was designated for school construction projects p. 25 ."
Support,"school uniforms simplify morning routines, as the child wears the same thing every day.","anything done to make a school morning less stressful is beneficial , as it allows children to have more sleep, essential to a successful day, or to prepare themselves mentally for school."
Attack,schools can infringe on the parents' rights to make decisions about the social and religious upbringing of their children.,"with the decision being left to parents, the child's opinions are not likely to be expressed."
Attack,"providing pregnancy tests and ultrasounds, which are free or subsidized at planned parenthood , through hospitals will increase medical costs .","this represents a change in funding source rather than cost, since the total number of pregnancy tests performed would not change substantially and the cost to manufacture and administer the tests would remain the same."
Attack,"sex hormones such as estrogen, progesterone, and testosterone play an integral role in the development of gender differences.","testosterone, a hormone typically associated with men, and estrogen, a hormone typically associated with women, are present in all humans ."
Support,"christianity initiated the crusades , a series of religious wars against muslims in the middle east.","between two and six million europeans died in the crusades, which represented almost 10 of the european population at the time p. 2 ."
Support,"many alien abductees report sexual intercourse including the claims by later lawyer brazilian antônio vilas boas from 1957 , david huggins , chinese meng zhaoguo from 1994 , mark h. , jesse long jr. , ron johnson , and uk politician simon parkes and even more report probing of genitals , insemination , semen being taken away, fetuses being taken away, etc .",there is little reason for people to make such claims if they weren't true due to the ridicule and career risks etc doing is or at least was associated with.

Attack,"high physical performance is only important for athletics, not common everyday life.","superior physical attributes are a significant factor in law enforcement and military careers, not just sports."
Support,"much of the earth s crust hangs in a tenuous balance of gases, so even a slight change in underground pressure can cause earthquakes.",there have been many incidents of underground co2 storage causing earthquakes.
Support,"if alien presence and activity on earth gets widely acknowledged, that may make their activity such as alien abductions or potential hybridization offspring programs more difficult, e.g. because they may be considered outside the current or then created bounds of laws or because people apply more countermeasures like certain monitoring technologies and so on.","ted rice claims he saw mantid aliens eating infants children and that he has not heard about any evidence of them being benign. this may be consistent with e.g. huggins who claimed to have seen a room full of his babies during an abduction albeit with gray alien heads and parkes who in some regression stated he saw mantid aliens were killing children as their culture. phil schneider also claimed this. if anything of that was true, that may motivate agencies and aliens to keep things secret."
Attack,"finland will soon field advanced us made military technology, including f 35 fighter jets.",the us is likely to withhold some advanced military technology in order to maintain its national security.
Attack,utilitarianism would argue that the time and resources used to create and view porn could be better used to minimize suffering.,"even if we were to assume a zero sum economy, which is unproven , it is not a given that resources used in pornography would otherwise be used for beneficial purposes."
Attack,the environment's capacity to absorb and sequester carbon has so far kept pace with increasing greenhouse gas emissions.,climate change may make carbon sinks less effective .
Attack,wealth redistribution schemes are unjust because they violate the moral right individuals have over their private property.,"if a ubi was funded through taxation, it would be a legitimate government service."
Attack,religion teaches people to be content with what they have and to be thankful to god so that they can be rewarded in the afterlife.,"religion also leads people to believe they are entitled to great things, as promised by their god."
Attack,"philippians 2:5 8 describes jesus, in his humility, taking on the very nature of a servant and being made in human likeness . to become incarnate in an exceptionally good looking human body would contradict this humility.",one can have a dignified and humble beauty. this is the sort jesus had.
Support,it's not creation but accumulation of wealth that is incentivized.,the accumulation of wealth is harmful to the economy.
Attack,ending patients suffering through euthanasia can clearly be argued as a benefit to the patient .,it is dishonest to present killing as an act of therapy or healing.
Attack,individual progress of life is less importance in a communist system.,"in communism, individuals would have much more freedoms and time for self expression since their health and survival needs would be accounted for."
Support,"the pursuit of happiness, also defined as freedom to, is inalienable as it was a natural freedom prior to the creation of a polity.",we establish our moral code based on the state of the world around us. we see rights that we enjoy and cannot articulate any reason why others should have more less right to these. this allows objective establishment of frameworks of morality and ethics.
Support,genetically modified seeds and associated research technologies are patented by a minority of major corporations p. xix . these patents can be used to financially exploit smaller scale players in the gmo industry. a blanket ban on gm food would be the surest way to prevent this.,leading scientists have warned that the dependency on large corporations that genetically modified seed patents encourage leaves farmers in developing countries incredibly vulnerable to sudden price hikes or seed withdrawals.
Attack,"confederate memorials, monuments, and flags enable public worshipping of the white supremacy ideology: this creates a strengthening and uniting effect for its supporters.","this implies that most if not all of those in favor of keeping the statues are white supremacists, which is a baseless claim."
Support,trump supporters believe there was fraud only due to a months long effort by the trump administration to delegitimize the result of the election.,"trump has repeatedly refused to condemn sources of misinformation, like followers of the qanon conspiracy ."
Support,"learned biases can be counteracted. if they can be identified and their effect quantified, ai can be programmed to ignore such biases.",this implies that agi should not necessarily be trained to think like humans.
Support,"teachers modeling and practicing empathy is essential for building healthy relationships with students. without it, students would be disadvantaged in the classroom.",empathetic teachers are more supportive of struggling students. emphasising such a value in the curriculum can help it to be encouraged within the classroom.
Support,protesting is an individuals way of communicating their views and ideas to the government; similar to a pressure group. this is essential for the government to continue to serve the people.,"the government cannot shut down opinions, just because some people disagree. shutting down protests in front of abortion clinics would create a precedent to shut down common protests against banking sector, death penalty, the oil lobby etc. as well."
Support,"the scientific community, like any other, is subject to social pressure.",scientific research is often conducted with funding from external agencies with vested interest in the study findings. this poses serious conflicts of interest that could implicitly influence study findings.
Support,to get to a point where all cultural groups are well represented will take a long time. this means that feelings of tokenism will still persist for a considerable period.,some organisations may find that there is not enough culturally diverse talent from which to recruit. this delays the process of improving cultural representation.
Attack,"complete separation between human and animal already exists in many places around the world. complex species can be found in such places. yet, there are still no species that even come close to human intelligence.",discoveries continue to be made regarding the extent of animal intelligence. we do not know how many additional species we may find in the future.
Attack,"the simplicity might be a political liability, as the populace might be incredulous that its benefits can be real given the simplicity of the change.","approval voting doesn't have to be sold as the best system or as a big change; advocates can simply claim it's an improvement, or the easy first step towards other democratic reform, without having to explain the plan."
Support,"politicians may not be willing to implement hard controls that undermine human rights out of fear of being voted out of office. therefore, softer controls would be preferred.","coercion is a blunt substitute for progressive policies; governments have learned better techniques, such as nudge , which have proven to be cheap and effective ."
Support,one event in world history can not be conflated to mean women are better leaders overall.,"it is possible that women may lead well when faced with specific dilemmas, while men lead well when facing others."

Attack,"this concerns the individual's right to speak against a government, system, or institution conceptual bodies which do not have unalienable rights. it is different when an individual speaks to another individual, because both people have the same unalienable rights.",us supreme court case citizens united ruled that corporate personhood grants corporations free speech protection . corporations are institutions which have the same unalienable rights as individuals.
Attack,"since murder is justified in self defense , the right to life is not particularly sacred.","self defense is only legitimate as a last resort. in the case of the death penalty, there is time to act due to a lack of imminent threat. thus, killing is unjustified."
Attack,"considering the ideology of john stuart mill , nationhood wouldn t matter because what really matters is making most of the people happy by not hurting civilians.","since russia is the one hurting civilians, they could simply stop their invasion and make everyone happy."
Attack,trump had a good eye for real estate business opportunities.,donald trump's resorts have consistently experienced losses.
Attack,decriminalisation would likely increase access to services for drug users.,this would only be true if decriminalisation was accompanied by active rehabilitation programs.

Attack,rejecting gun control legislation as a partial solution because it is not a perfect solution is an example of the nirvana fallacy .,the effectiveness of gun control legislation is not a black and white issue; it is reasonable to reject measures that are likely to be ineffective or pose significant new issues.
Attack,"gender is a social construct and is, therefore, distinct from sex, which is a biological categorization. thus, it is faulty to infer gender based on sex.","while inferring gender based on biological sex may be faulty, it remains a common practice. as such, removing gender may lead to the creation of a more accurate marker."
Attack,"many elders have issues with modern technology , making e courses difficult for them.","many elders have lower compliance compared to youth , even regarding their own safety , anyways. they merely prefer to blame technology and complex interfaces ."
Support,"the proof of stake algorithm is being researched for bitcoin as an alternative to proof of work , which could significantly reduce its energy consumption.",moving from proof of work to proof of stake will cut energy consumption by ninety nine percent .
Support,"modern european monarchies are not forms of government, but merely symbols.",in modern european countries there is no way for monarchs to influence the process of law making.
Support,baptism by pouring is a safe and valid alternative to immersion.,"baptism by immersion requires a large amount of water, which isn't always available. pouring makes baptism possible with only a small quantity of water."
Support,cultural diversity in the workplace may lead to greater profits for an organisation.,cultural diversity in the workplace may have a positive influence on the reputation of a company leading to more consumers.
Attack,"anti feminists would not exist if there was no feminist movement, therefore feminists are responsible for the creation of anti feminists.","to be responsible, feminists should have had some control over anti feminists, which is not the case. anti feminists created their movement on their own, they re responsible for their own actions."
Attack,"social media platforms like facebook and twitter, have machine learning algorithms that maximize ad dollars and time on site through promoting conspiracies and outrage inducing content.","on the other hand, facebook, twitter and co benefit the people by offering their great services completely free of charge by using their data and displaying adds."
Attack,"mother teresa sought to embrace, rather than alleviate, suffering. though these beliefs may seem alien and bizarre to the secular world, they are aligned with church teaching and biblical principles.","church teaching and biblical principles do not hold unequivocally positive views toward suffering. parables such as the good samaritan , for example, teach followers to do all they can to alleviate the suffering of others."
Attack,gender cannot be a social construct as gender is self chosen ; it is not influenced by society since it is up to the individual to determine their own gender.,"gender can be considered as both a social construct and self chosen, since it represents a navigation between the individual and society."
Attack,climate change is harmful for humans and nature p. 67 .,"even profound changes to the climate will not negatively impact the natural world as a whole, which has persisted through massive changes to the climate and ecosystems."
Attack,the funds collected could be used to address environmental problems.,"the introduction of a deposit system could incentivize counterfeit operations, where individuals might produce counterfeit water bottles to claim deposits, leading to fraud and further environmental damage."
Support,"though more inclusive, the gender spectrum does consist of categories, which could establish new stereotypes and norms for each of several genders.","gender categories are harmful, as expectations to conform to one's gender category can be damaging."
Support,shadow libraries nearly solve the problem of paywalls through technological means. technological solutions are often better than legal or policy based ones as they are more robust and enable greater resilience and independence.,"as of 2023, it seems impossible to build humanity's largest public libraries legally. thus they can only be built as shadow libraries and facilitating people to use them can aid their development, maintenance, and resilience. humanity's largest literature library, anna's archive is a shadow library and these have pioneered the adoption of digital resilience technologies ."
Attack,sex offenders can seek protection using police and home security systems.,mistaken identity is common in cases of vigilante and mob justice. such policies would also place innocent people at risk even if ex convicts receive protection.
Support,differences in doctrine have precipitated a number of wars and violent conflicts between different christian sects and denominations.,religious sectarianism was the primary motivation for the british civil wars and the irish troubles .
Attack,"an adult has more established interests and dreams, meaning that they are denied more by losing their lives than a child who has yet to consider long term interests or dreams.",even those without clearly defined interests and dreams have a desire to survive.
Attack,strict election and campaign laws are a better way to reduce the costs of political campaigns and elections as a whole.,such laws are often overturned . compulsory voting is a better long term way to reduce these costs.
Attack,"since undocumented immigrants are able to work for less money, companies hire them instead of americans. this results in american workers not having jobs.",decades of data have actually contradicted the myth that immigrants create unemployment and lower wages for american laborers.
Support,"historically, people advocated for racially segregated bathrooms citing concerns about threat and violence which are currently being used to justify gender segregated bathrooms. disregarding such norms facilitates social progress.",concerns about violence in gender neutral bathrooms assume that transgender people pose a threat to others and the order of society. deconstructing this misbelief will lead to greater acceptance of transgender people in society.
Attack,we all share an intrinsic desire to increase the happiness decrease the unhappiness of ourselves and others we care about. this is built into us by nature which is why having sex and eating food is pleasurable but being hurt or ill is painful. we want those we care about to have happy rather than unhappy lives because caring about them necessarily entails this. all other goals in life are ultimately instrumental and relate to this intrinsic value that we all share whether we realize it or not.,"i am not sure what happiness has to do with morality and moral values. lots of things considered moral could well make one unhappy! one might be very happy if one slept with a certain someone other than one's partner, but in many cultures this would not be considered moral. being moral would make one unhappy. the purpose of morality is social cohesion through commonly agreed norms to ensure a culture thrives and is not reduced to war and chaos therefore impeding the success of that culture."
Attack,the 2020 elections saw a spate of prosecutors elected who were against the death penalty.,some prosecutors who ran against the death penalty saw backlash from both conservatives and liberals.
Attack,the goal of prison is to punish and contain criminals not reinstate them into society.,"if the purpose of prison is to contain dangerous criminals for the safety of the community, with no thought of preparing them to return to the greater community, it would be best, safer and more cost effective to execute the criminal. this would guarantee the criminal could never pose a threat to anyone ever again."
Attack,"ever since popular vote numbers have been recorded, not a single us president received the support of more than 42 of eligible voters.",many people choose not to vote. this is their right.
Support,"trump has refocused military operations to aggressively target the taliban, increasing the efficacy of us military operations.","at the very least, this has streamlined the decision making process , speeding up decision making cycles and allowing the us military to respond in time to on the ground situations."

Support,transhumanism would one day get advanced enough that surgical rejection is only a problem of the past.,cybernetics could get so advanced that people's minds would be uploaded and placed into a mechanical body. there would be no biological material to worry about rejection with.
Attack,the war on drugs has done far more damage to the environment than drug production.,"this statement is nearly impossible to support, as there are no detailed comparative studies of the environmental damage wrought by drug production and the war on drugs."
Attack,"hardly anyone is very consistently open minded and critical, and we don't know how to make them that way expecting a class in epistemology to achieve such results is hopelessly optimistic.","the grandparent claim mentioned the efficient teaching of epistemology, logic and psychological biases. this is far more than a mere class in epistemology."
Support,"guns and other dangerous weapons are not legal nor available in all the countries , therefore, fighting might still be the prefered method of attack in many places.","japan, is considered to have a zero tolerance regarding gun ownership which has resulted in low rates of gun crime."
Support,"this may be one of the two best fits for how most origins are explained: e.g. humans are caused by earlier humans and homo sapiens is caused by a continuum of earlier animals and precursors , starting with e.g. highly uncomplex objects of the chemistry to protocells period and so on. by the principle of occam's razor , such explanations may be fit to prioritize in cosmological and generally cognitive efforts. moreover, it could enable cosmological natural selection .","measures or metrics that evaluate the viability, likelihood, reasonability, coherence, and so on of cosmological hypotheses would require some level of explanation. such measures could include: explanatory power, unsolved problems, and so on. these are useful since many of the hypotheses are not falsifiable."
Attack,colonizing mars is a stepping stone to further expansion that could help preserve the human race from any event on any celestial body diversifying instead of 'putting all eggs in one basket' .,we do not know how this could affect our species from a evolutionary perspective. colonies could house generations and those could potentially be affected by living there.
Support,"factors that contribute significantly to conflict such as culture , race, and religion will continue to exist in the same way.",animosity between groups can often be rooted in past conflict. this is unlikely to simply be forgotten once they are incorporated into a single state.
Support,a society is just when it is as equal as possible.,john rawls's theory of justice puts forth the idea that a just society must be constructed so that a rational individual would accept citizenship even with the possibility of occupying the most disadvantaged position in that society.
Support,"market forces distort the cost of fossil fuels, as companies benefit from global subsidies equivalent to us 10 million a minute every day . given this, it is better to opt for the greener energy source.",the uk acknowledged that they use fossil fuel subsidies in 2009 as part of the g20 pledge to phase out inefficient fossil fuel subsidies.
Support,"if there is an objective morality, and it was imposed by god, then whether or not you believe in god is irrelevant because morality remains objective.","innate morality transmitted genetically was either programmed by a creator or naturally selected. natural selection is subject to environmental changes and specific lineage, therefore objective morality can only be achieved through genetic programming."
Attack,"overpopulation is not the cause of these issues; rather, an inefficiency in the global distribution of resources cause climate change.","overpopulation and inefficiency are both factors. in all likelihood, the inefficiency will continue, thus attempts should be used to reduce both factors."
Attack,fitness games are often not rigorous enough to actually motivate players to exercise.,"while playing fitness games may not be rigorous enough to replace the gym, they have been shown to be an effective complementary tool for dedicated workouts."
Attack,"the universe is finely tuned , which is evidence that an intelligent mind was responsible.",the universe and the prevailing laws of nature seem to be finely tuned only from the human perspective.
Support,trump's policies were against scientific and social progress.,trump tried to eliminate the national endowment for the arts nea .
Attack,treating climate change as irreversible is defeatist and ignores the progress that has been made towards averting it.,it's not defeatist to acknowledge that climate change is an existing problem and that we are having to adapt to it. that's just reality. we can adapt to the current situation we face and work to avert it at the same time.
Support,tolerance is increasing with each generation in the usa.,"as of may 2015, 27 of millennials in the us said that they were raised in mixed religion households, compared to 20 of generation x, 19 of baby boomers, and only 13 of those born pre 1946. this suggests that interfaith marriages are increasing at a rate in line with overall religious tolerance."
Support,polygamy makes life easier for all parties involved.,those in polygamous marriages are surrounded by people that are dealing with the same issues and emotions. this is a wonderful form of support for all types of problems.
Attack,low income households have too few capital goods to represent much of a draw on the world s finite reserves of metals and other non renewable resources.,"half of the world's population are poor. combined, they can therefore still represent a colossal draw on the world's resources."
Support,"a ubi gives everyone money to spend on goods and services, therefore increasing aggregate demand and economic growth.","a ubi would likely have a growth effect on the market by putting money in the hands of the impoverished, who studies have proven spend a greater percentage of their income than wealthier individuals."
Attack,"christianity encourages evangelism to spread the word of god, including missionaries who travel and live amongst non believer populations.","missionaries might associate with anyone, but historically their purpose was not always peaceful for example the forced conversions of the british empire ."
Attack,"many of the animals that we kill for meat, such as kangaroos or deer, are pests that are bad for natural ecosystems or for agriculture. demand for their meat actually creates net benefits for the environment.","if it is beneficial to kill pests, then we can do that without needing to eat their meat."
Support,"consistent and absolute moral standards are not a good goal when all moral ethics need be absolute and none can vary e.g. between regions, jurisdictions, nations, religions, and or cultures .",nothing indicates such consistency or absoluteness are needed or beneficial and there are views on this question other than total moral absolutism . having moral ethics that are considered 'perfect and unchanging' is even more problematic in many cases or domains than otherwise.
Support,"traditional schools expose students to bullying, as well as physical, psychological, and sexual violence from other students p. 7 .","oftentimes, aggressive and violent students are protected instead of being expelled after successive outbursts."
Attack,"hiring a real estate broker to do this is unnecessary, since people close to you can help. in case that option is not possible either, you could hire someone for 15 hour and just have them there to make sure strangers walking in to see the house don't steal anything or damage the property.",real estate brokers do selling. someone hired for 15 per hour is most likely not trained to sell.
Support,"parents are naturally inclined to feel a responsibility for their children, which is unlikely to be affected by education.","parents continue to feel responsibility for encouraging sports and extra curriculars in their children, despite schools offering physical education classes."
Support,"a liquid democracy could have a similar system of checks and balances as existing democracies, with seperation of power between legislative, executive, and judicial branches.",a strong constitution that limits what can be legislated would be critical to a successful implementation of liquid democracy.
Support,the watchtower falsely predicted that the end of the world would come in 1975.,"in 1968 they predicted , i know enough of what is going on to assure you that, in fifteen years from today, this world is going to be too dangerous to live in."
Attack,"after cain kills abel, he laments whoever finds me will kill me genesis 4:14 . this would be a strange thing to say if cain and his parents were the only humans in existence.",adam and eve could have had many children other than cain and abel before this incident.
Support,different victims have very different notions of what is meant by closure.,"incorporating such a concept into the law leads to inconsistent and unequal outcomes, which is unfair."
Support,"musk's stance on free speech is that which matches the law , which is already the principle under which twitter currently operates, so there would be no changes.",musk has described himself as a free speech absolutist because he believes in allowing any content as long as it doesn t run afoul of the law .

Attack,many violent criminals who are later released are less likely to re offend.,the us sentencing commission finds differently. they report that violent offenders are more likely to re offend.
Support,this change was justified because the former translation better fits the original hebrew.,"the original hebrew of exodus 21:22 describes what happens as yatsa yeled literally the child comes out , which does not imply a miscarriage or the death of the baby."
Support,the mainstream media in many countries perpetuates harmful rhetoric that often vilifies their muslim residents.,the mainstream media's disproportionately negative coverage of muslims opens the door to more radical and dangerous manifestations of islamophobia .
Attack,"unarmed self defense techniques are less effective and practical, especially for the physically disadvantaged, than being armed.",carrying weapons increase the risk of escalating conflicts.
Attack,"people would get skin issues such as sunburn and skin cancer from the sun less often, as mars is much further away from the sun than earth.","unless properly shielded, people could actually get more skin damage from the sun and cosmic radiation, because on mars there is no ozone layer or significant magnetosphere to stop uv rays and charged particles."
Attack,had the filmmakers of the force awakens intended luke's reaction to be relief and a preparedness to return to battle they would have included a scene in which that was explicit. they created a deliberately ambiguous ending.,a neutral expression on luke's face would have created ambiguity. this facial expression shows luke literally on the verge of tears.
Support,excess charges from financial institutions like banks and credit card companies could be eliminated with the use of cryptocurrencies.,banks have been criticized in recent years for increasing the size and number of extra charges for their services.
Attack,"increased pressure to redistribute wealth does not mean it will necessarily lead to rapid reform. despite increased pressure to target the richest in society , radical reforms in wealth redistribution remain uncommon.","this particular analysis is based on information in the forbes list, which presents wealth in an overwhelmingly positive light. a more critical presentation of wealth is more likely to lead to demands for change."
Support,"human life has no specific, objective value. it is valuated differently by any number of philosophical, spiritual, and ethical ideologies.","there are different schools of thought on the meaning of life. if there was an objective value, there would be no divergence."
Attack,"with closed timelike curves , spacetimes may return to their starting points.",it is unclear what more exactly is meant and how it relates to this question.

Attack,"this statistic of medicare costs removes all costs of collection and most administration costs. for example, the costs of the irs and congress are not included in these statistics, but would be included for private companies.",private health insurance companies run an average of about 5 net profit margin. that would not be mirrored in a government run program.
Support,women in senior positions can alter the culture of companies in order to support women in lower positions.,the presence of women in management settings can expose previously overlooked barriers to entry and allow those to be tackled.
Support,"it is possible for human intuitions, which result from human nature, to be wrong due to our cognitive biases . if our natural intuitions can be wrong, then our possession of those intuitions does not imply that an objective moral truth exists.","this fact is perfectly explainable without a sensus moralis : without us having the beliefs we do in virtue of some epistemic access to moral facts. the explanation is to be given in evolutionary terms. for some reason or other and this is a heated dispute , it was advantageous to each and every member of the homo genus to have specific false beliefs about morality. the beliefs thus generated could be reasonably uniform, even though they would all be false."
Attack,the dickey and tiahrt amendments have made it nearly impossible for the government to sufficiently research or analyze gun violence statistics to support or refute this point.,"despite the dickey amendment, gun violence research in recent years has actually increased, since the us government has continued to fund it through the nih ."

Support,"many countries provide universal healthcare , showing that any detrimental economic effects are not substantial.",there is evidence to suggest that a single payer system allows for negotiations that would actually drive down the price of services.
Attack,history makes it abundantly clear that citizens make social change possible by spurring the government to take action.,"even if the desired changes are unequivocally desirable, ethical, and justified, the public may lack the depth and breadth of knowledge that the government possesses to foresee and mitigate the unanticipated adverse consequences that could result from hastily implementing the required changes."
Attack,the overall number of circumcised children could decrease dramatically if child circumcision was treated as severely as child female genital mutilation.,"severe punishments for parents who circumcise their children may hurt the wellbeing of those children even more, while the alleged damage of circumcision cannot be undone."
Attack,the united states spends more per student on football than on mathematics. this misplaced prioritization damages america's economic competitiveness.,"comparing spending on football to spending on mathematics is misleading because educational spending is not a zero sum game. that is, it is possible to spend on both football and mathematics, or on neither."
Support,consciousness and the ability to feel pain is undeniably restricted to humans and animals. this similarity obliges humans to strive to avoid and abolish human and animal suffering alike.,aggression towards sentient life is justifiable in the case of self preservation killing parasites causing disease and self defence stopping a life threatening attack .
Support,"food deserts are not doomed to be food deserts forever. as technology changes , new solutions may be found to make fresh food more readily available in these areas.","modern urban farming techniques such as hydroponics , aquaponics , and microfarming could combat food deserts while saving animals from harm."
Support,the south did not have a monopoly on racism. abraham lincoln would be considered a white supremacist and a white nationalist by today's standards.,"had lincoln survived after the war, there were plans to send all previous slaves to central america. it would be consistent to destroy monuments to lincoln as racist and white supremacist."
Support,many inventions prior to the industrial revolution increased the standard of living.,alcohol was invented prior to the industrial revolution and improved the standard of living.
Support,the fact that vampires are sentient and yet cause harm to humans makes them more deserving of death.,"in the criminal justice system, murder is punished more severely than manslaughter because the former carries sentient intent."
Attack,"human bodies are largely not able to kill animals on their own, implying it is not natural to do so. humans often need tools to kill animals, unlike other predators.",many non human animals use tools to kill their prey.
Support,the absence of male genitalia is not what makes women only spaces safe and supportive for women.,"women only safe spaces exist as a form of protection against harassment and violence, particularly that of a sexual nature, which happens to women regardless of their genitalia p. 5 ."
Support,"taking resources away from one population earthlings to give to another martians is morally questionable as it incorporates favoritism, which tends to be immoral.","if we send people to mars, then we would need to make sacrifices somewhere. this means only one side gets favored at the expense of the other side, mainly martians getting earthly resources or vice versa: martians do not get to go to mars to protect earthlings."
Attack,"evidence suggests that a majority of muslims hold views that violate principles of liberty and freedom, and can be quite extremist.",the scripture of the quran preaches peacefulness and moderation to its followers.

Attack,the most commonly cited reason for gun ownership in the us is recreation pp. 2 3 .,people would likely be able to continue to visit shooting ranges and gun clubs even with stricter gun control legislation; such places would likely continue to exist as they are protected and regulated by statutes in every us state pp. 7 100 .

Attack,"choosing to center the plot on the remnant of the resistance leading a slow motion chase in space until they run out of fuel, made this the bravest of the core films. the slow and seemingly certain doom faced by the resistance were huge stakes set in a seemingly small narrative.","in regards to being the bravest of the core films, many would hold the original movie as being the most brave or daring. people tend to forget that most companies and their executives told george lucas that his movie would be a failure and wanted nothing to do with it. the movie is also responsible for many new innovations in special effects."

Support,"women's bathrooms are often called powder rooms , and women often excuse themselves by saying i need to powder my nose when they need to the use the bathroom. this shows that bathrooms are commonly used to apply makeup.","applying makeup in public places is considered uncouth . for this reason, women need to use private spaces like bathrooms to re apply makeup."

Attack,"if turkey were to join the eu, all trade deals would have to be negotiated as a bloc, giving turkey less freedom in deciding its own trade deals.",the benefit of being part of the eu's significant number of current and future trade deals outweighs any potential loss in control over negotiating trade deals that would come about from turkey joining the eu.

Support,"ia machines that lack the freedom and ability to navigate the world would be fundamentally limited, and thus could not achieve the full potential of agi.","for example, agi with fundamental rights would combine all the benefits of von neumann probes , or self replicating robots designed to explore outer space, with the capacities of free thought, intelligence, and creativity needed for space exploration."
Support,"over the past four decades, sexist prejudices have decreased alongside the gender pay gap . this diminishes the need for government intervention, as discrimination is being ameliorated naturally.","skills typically associated with women, like people management, used to be undervalued p. 27 . greater recognition of these skills contributed to the decrease in the pay gap."

Attack,"science aims to describe the world. it does not prescribe how to act based on those descriptions. that is, it does not dictate policy. theguardian.com","how the world is determines whether a policy is good or bad. for example a policy of extending all prison sentences is a good policy if we live in a world where longer prison sentences make people less likely to re offend, however this policy is bad if the length of the prison sentence has no impact on likelihood of re offence, hence given a policy maker's objectives empirical facts do dictate policy."

Attack,"the historical record has numerous examples of state breakdown leading to violence it has historically always been paired with civil violence, and has always proved temporary, as the violence has only continued until a single authority has claimed the dominant authority over a given territory.","the belief of a breakdown of society is the cause of this chaos, the belief that it will be chaos causes chaos. if people believed courts would be quickly re established and that the communities would band together to defend property and enforce law during the time, they would not believe it is chaos."
Support,telling people that their bodies are socially unacceptable does not help them lose weight.,people who are made to feel ashamed of their weight have been shown to have worse health than those who are not shamed.

Support,"it has not been demonstrated that omnibenevolence must be defined so as to be logically inconsistent with permitting the presence of any kind of evil for any duration. as it stands, the inconsistency is tautologically assumed, not explicitly demonstrated.","god dealing with evil in itself necessitates that evil exists to be dealt with. though evil should be dealt with by a good all powerful god, it must exist for a time before being dealt with. we are in that time before it is completely dealt with"
Attack,"the free media is a very useful tool for ensuring the accountability of powerful actors. in a one world state, media accountability is likely to be even more effective than the present.","in a one world state, whistleblowers would have no other country to flee to, and would therefore be much more vulnerable to state retaliation. this would drastically reduce the accountability of the state."

Attack,"privacy is not an absolute good; society often disregards privacy to deter crime. as such, if public approaches for sex improve society, privacy should be disregarded.","approaching a stranger publicly for sex is individualistic, as only a few people may gain from any approach. as such, it cannot outweigh the social good of privacy."
Attack,many prophecies presented in jesus' favour were not actually recognized as messianic prophecies by jews.,modern jews do not recognize these prophecies because most of those that did realized jesus fit them and then converted to christianity.

Attack,"an example would be talking about the crime rate in black communities. for someone especially a caucasian to merely bring it up even in a polite and civil manner can be very triggering to people. out of fear of offending these people and being seen as a bigot, all comments that may put blame on the minority or put them in a negative light are avoided.",talking factually about crime in a community is not triggering. blaming the cause of the crime on simply being black would blatant racism. tying the crime to a racial stereotype would be as well. whoever it is that is triggering people with the hypothetical polite statements probably doesn't even know they are being racist.
Attack,"americans can honor their ancestors who fought in the confederacy for their sacrifices, be glad that the south lost, and still abhor slavery at the same time.","the notion that these monuments honor these people for anything other than their white supremacy is refuted by the absence of statues to longstreet. longstreet was lee's most trusted general, but in the aftermath of the war he advocated reconciling with the former enemy and worked in political coalitions with the newly freed citizens. and yet there are virtually no monuments to longstreet"
Support,"religion creates divides in the people, and often leads to viewing those outside the community as lesser or not deserving.","this would create biases against minority religions and atheists, because of which they may be treated unfairly."

Attack,"the limits of the universe show that the cause of the universe, being the creator, must be infinite, if he is to implement an infinite diversity of limits measurements in this seemingly infinite world. because our universe is definite, in so many infinite ways with everything being calculable , it stands to reason there must be an infinite designer capable of doing seemingly anything. therefore, god is the only answer.",great complexity can emerge from very simple rules. thus the cause of the universe may be something simple and mindless. they why call it god?
Attack,"values need not be conscious to be present and active. conscious or not, these values are what we use to make choices and evaluate people, options, futures, etc. moral conclusions necessarily follow from these values, the way the conclusion of a syllogism follows from its premises. at most, the conclusion reveals the values that went into making it.","assuming a starting position is where all thoughts start. this is more indicative of an objective moral reality than a subjective one, since all subjective inclinations feed off the assumed starting point."

Attack,what we have is good enough and has served us well for over 200 years.,"the constitution has been unable to keep up with advances in technology, scientific understanding of human behaviour, globalization, advancements in weapons and civil rights issues; the claim that it served us well is not an objective fact but a subjective opinion."
